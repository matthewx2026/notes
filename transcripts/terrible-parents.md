so the Hebrews created history as we know it don't get away with anything and so you might think you can bend the fabric of reality and that you can treat people instrumentally and that you can bow to the Tyrant and violate your conscience without cost you will pay the piper it's going to call you out of that slavery into Freedom even if that pulls you into the desert and we're going to see that there's something else going on here that is far more Cosmic and deeper than what you can imagine the highest ethical Spirit to which we're beholden is presented precisely as that spirit that allies itself with the cause of Freedom against tyranny I want villains to get punished but do you want the villains to learn before they have to pay the ultimate price that's such a Christian question for a long time on the self-esteem front there was this idea that positive affirmations for children were the way to self-esteem all that false praise that devaluation of the currency of reward that over generalization of of uh insistence upon your child's singular wonderfulness at the expense of other people it didn't improve self-esteem what it did was inflate narcissism and so all this idiot insistence on self-esteem through continual affirmation you produce this increase in self-centered narcissism and you make kids more isolated and miserable and lonely than they would have otherwise had to be when I worked with parents it was constantly you know a child would come home and say somebody kicked me in the playground and the first question from the parent was not so what did you do about it or what happened but and how did that make you feel and and what it does is it gives power to feelings above actions and so you you get a child who then the child stops and thinks well how did I feel about it and it's usually you know sad or angry or happy you know this sort of very limited range of feeling words if we bring that back every time to the child's feelings and the child is growing up thinking my feelings are the most important thing thank you hello everyone watching or listening on YouTube or Associated podcaster on The Daily wear plus platform I have the privilege today of speaking to Stephanie Davies awry she is a decorated author and the founder as well as the Director of transgender Trend a uk-based organization that has been perpetually Under Fire by leftist activists simply for advocating for evidence-based health care when it comes to gender dysphoric children she's also the author of communicating with kids book published in 2015 based on her background training teachers and providing parental support Davies awry is also notable for being an intervener in the high court during the landmark case Bell versus Tavistock which concluded that persons under 18 cannot consent to puberty blockers so Stephanie I was reading your book today 2015 book communicating with children and I thought maybe I could playfully put you on the spot in my First Book 12 rules for life I my first popular book I have a chapter entitled don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike them and so what I thought I'd ask you given uh given that you wrote this book detailing out different means of communicating with children developing a philosophy of communication with children I'm kind of wondering what you think of that rule how does that strike you don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike them I love that you started with that because that's the bit in your book which I've read um that jumped out as me at me because that's what I say to parents you know you of course you love your children to bits you die for them but do you like them because that's really important in day-to-day living but the other thing I say is that it's not only important that you like your own kids but the other parents do and other people outside because of the otherwise your kids are going to have a really hard time and you're not going to be doing them a favor if you bring them up to be unpopular with other kids parents because they're gonna they're gonna depend on them so okay so so let me outline a few ideas for you and you tell me criticize away or agree as you see fit so I think we know there's a large literature indicating that it's better for for children to have two parents and I think the reason for that this is my reasoning for it there's a variety of reasons obviously raising children and working is very difficult so being able to split the labor is a way of perhaps not being entirely exhausted when you have small children but I think there's something else going on too which is more it's it's Akin in some sense to the reason that there's sexual differentiation at a biological level so there's sexual differentiation because it's useful to bring together two disparate creatures to produce a new variant but I also think it's true on the personality front so if you have a nicely organized marriage you know you're going to have your bits of insanity and your partner is going to have their bits of insanity but if you can form a joint Union then I believe you can produce something approximating one sane person and so and that person is saying that joint person is saying not so much because they're saying psychologically but because they're an analog of the broader social world so and I'm making I'm saying that for a specific reason so then the theory would be if your children are acting in a way that both of you find displeasing if you're honest then the probability that other people will find that displeasing is extremely high because you at least love your children whereas other people you know they might be willing to give them a chance but they're not going to die for them and so if you accept the additional hypothesis that the primary role of a parent is to prepare their children for for what would you say welcome acceptance into the broader social world then you have a moral obligation to guide your children in some sense in accordance with your own joint feelings if if the two of you find your child's behavior unacceptable you're morally obligated to let the child know because that is not going to translate well to other children to other children's parents to teachers to any situations in public and then your child's going to have a miserable time of it and I I think the research literature indicates that very clearly yeah and I think you know you're right in the sense that the children need the male and the female the masculine the feminine but that can be achieved in other ways I've worked with all kinds of families so uh my work is about um make creating the optimum situation for families no matter what the whether they're married or or what kind of family situation they're in so I would agree and particularly that children need strong role models of the opposite sex and the same sex so you know if it's a single parent family for example to find those role models that are close family members because I've you know all very good friends of the family that it has to be a close relationship I mean teachers as well but there are other adults who can fill that Gap and and that is that I think is very important that that Gap is filled if the family isn't that a male female unit of of marriage that is the traditional unit right because the children have to learn okay so there's two elements there so you bring uh mother and a father together and you the child gets the benefit of their joint personality right the fact that they've got two people to hit against and hopefully that makes one sane person but the socialization rules for being feminine and the socialization rules for being masculine aren't identical and so that's part of the reason why it's necessary to have those contrary contracexual Role Models at hand and at hand does mean something like making a relationship with because the other thing we know about children is though they can establish multiple deep relationships with people so they can actually stand multiple caregivers but they don't really like a lot of change in their caregivers they don't like relationships once they're established to be to be decimated let's say well neither do adults but it's even more the case for children and so yeah it and it's harder for a single parent family for someone who's running a single parent family to fill that well fill that diversity of personality to solve that problem but also to provide the contracexual uh role model so I I agree I mean I think that consistency is really important for children and it's fractured in so many ways now in society because if people move around more people don't tend to stay in um those units or those extended family groups in one area so we have more and more more and more challenges today in bringing up children and parents face well I'm sure I'm sure you're aware um other challenges in terms of um online life the internet um influences from outside so yes that kind to try and create that consistency for children in their relationships in their close family relationships I think is one of the things that's very important um having said that I mean you know there are all sorts of situations that are not Optimum for children and it's it children are robust so you know you can look at in our Western Society for example to remember the fact that our children are you know generally very privileged um compared to other parts of the world and so we can get I think too concerned about what the um negative aspects of our society are and forget the fact that children are generally robust they are programmed to survive and to get on um and so we shouldn't be too careful or too worried about the kind of disadvantages they face in in uh you know sort of a western Society where they have many advantages Black Rifle coffee company is helping you knock out your holiday shopping with a ton of

there was this idea based on a I would say an oversimplified reading of Freud that all psychological problems that adults suffer from are a consequence of trauma often associated with poor parenting in childhood and first of all no because there's lots of reasons to have psychological distress as an adult that have nothing to do with your parents I mean as the existential psychotherapists pointed out very clearly in the 50s just the catastrophes associated with being alive are sufficient to cause people a substantial amount of depression and anxiety and hopelessness so it doesn't have to be all bad parenting and secondly the the extremes of terrible parenting that Freud noted aren't really I wouldn't say they're uncommon but they're not typical so Freud was particularly concerned with edible parenting and that would be well I suppose the modern equivalent of that is something like helicopter parenting is the potential Damage Done by someone who cares so much for their children that they're completely unable to give them any autonomy whatsoever but I think it's useful for parents to know that as you just pointed out the children are quite robust and they can adapt to a variety of circumstances and also that what you're trying to do with your children is actually have a relationship with them and one of the things that characterizes robust Human Relationships is that they can actually stay intact across a wide variety of emotional scenarios you know sometimes people in my clients used to wonder for example if they could have they should ever fight in front of their children and my response to that always was it's not whether or not you fight it's whether or not you reconcile and so what you want to do is model for your children the fact that there's going to be conflict about very important and difficult issues some of those interpersonal but some of them just practical that that conflict is actually going to produce a fair bit of emotion some of which might be negative and even rather intense but that those things can be negotiated through and the relationship can come back together we know for example even by studying our close primate relatives that chimpanzees that the males for example are extremely fractious in their interpersonal interactions but they're also ex the sophisticated ones are also extremely good at reconciling and peacemaking and so while the point of all this is that your children are perfectly capable of adapting to a wide range of emotional events positive and negative and what you want to help them understand is that the relationship you have with them and with each other if you're married is of the sort that's going to be able to withstand the full range of emotional expression without breaking apart and so they don't have to worry about them being fragile and you don't have to worry in some sense even about making mistakes with them as long as you're doing that in the same way you would do that with someone with whom you really want to maintain a long-term relationship it's a very rare married couple who don't fight who don't ever fight and don't ever and one of the things that I think is important as you say that children may see you fight and and of course by that I don't mean you know hugely aggressive throwing things or beating your partner up um but the normal kind of arguments and fights and that that that a couple would get into if the children observe that then I think you're right that it's important that they also see the making up um but they also learn that you're not perfect that conflict exists and that people resolve it and that it doesn't destroy you so I think that is really important right the other thing is about the you know anger and conflict and argument is is as you say just a normal part of life so if you try and I this is what I see the pressure on um parents and particularly mothers to be nice all the time to be be kind and nice and and never do anything in front of the children and you create a kind of false sort of a family and some of the some of the families I know that I think have the most healthy relationships the ones that shout at each other quite a lot um you know they're quite volatile in the way that they do so but they're very honest and they make up and they're very very close and loving families so you can't you know you get and then and then there are other families that try or the parents tried desperately hard to always present a you know a loving and kind and nice front and everything's false everything's there everything's under the surface then and that I think is very very confusing and anxiety provoking in children when you can feel the underground or undercurrence as children can but nobody's saying anything out loud right well that's part of that extended edible complex in some sense is that the issue is I mean it's perfectly reasonable for people to work towards having peace in their household but peace is actually extremely difficult to establish and maintain because peace means that both of you agree and also peace means that there's nothing unbelievably complicated facing you at the moment about which you have no idea why and you have no idea how to approach it you know if you have a sick child for example then and you're trying to sort through how to discipline a child like that let's say or what medical Pathway to walk down there's no way you can avoid having conflict if you're going to think about it because it's a very serious issue and you have to think about it seriously and that means you have to discuss it and if you have a different Viewpoint that discussion can get quite heated but there's no difference between that and thinking that heated discussion and unless you sort through say the complexities on the disciplinary and the medical treatment front you actually don't have peace right you just have a problem now what happens in the families that insist upon presenting this you might say gingerbread house world of false peace to their children is that they're pretending constantly that every problem is solved and peace actually Reigns but they're telling the children often through non-verbal behavior that any conflict whatsoever is so disruptive and so intolerable that we have to pretend all the time that no conflict whatsoever exists and so all that does is turn children into creatures that are terrified of their own negative emotions so they feel that if the if peace is so necessary and psyche's so fragile but no emotion whatsoever is in allowed on the negative side then any problem must be of terrifying proportions and only something to avoid and that's definitely that's definitely a catastrophe for children especially because they they can especially when they're little they can be quite volatile right I mean if they're tired or hungry or hot or cold and they get volatile they get upset and then if they're feeling that they're breaking the eggshells underneath the carpet or rattling the skeletons in the closet that's just not good for them at all yeah it teaches children to be afraid of conflict and disagreement and argument and from those are parts of a healthy relationship you you disagree and you um I I think that it when it comes to discipline disciplining the children that's an issue that is the adult's job and it shouldn't be done in front of the children that I mean it helps if parents share the same values but often there is a difference between I mean discipline and attitude discipline um this is so so common that one parent is more authoritarian and the other parent is more liberal and wants to to let the children get away with things more and the other one wants really tough discipline and that's so so common to get to a greater or lesser extent so those sorts of issues really need to be talked about and sorted out by the parents it's not the child's job to join in with um methods of his or her own discipline that is the parents job it's the adult's job and a child isn't you know and then the parents should be able to reach some agreement or compromise and and then you know see it but that shouldn't be part of the child's job it's not the child's job to you know yeah well you talked about two camps of discipline Camp a and Camp B Camp a associated with order let's say and integration into the social world and can't be Associated more let's say with chaos and individuation and that's kind of a conservative liberal split there too and I suppose that does reflect the fact that children have two problems to solve as they mature broadly speaking one is well how do I get along with my parents and my siblings and my friends and my teachers the whole social world how do I fit in so that's problem number one so that means how do I conduct myself so that people appreciate having me around and I'm a valued social member and the second problem is well how do I stand on my own two feet and also become a reliable source of creative individuality and some ability to push back against the mindlessness of the group and that is an optimization problem it's very complex and there's no simple answer to that partly because it depends on the situation and it depends on the child and so parents definitely have to negotiate that out I found with my wife I probably was I'd probably make the first disciplinary move in like 75 percent of the cases maybe 60 percent of the cases in our marriage I don't think that's that uncommon because men are more likely to intervene by and large than women are because they're less agreeable but I also found you know most of the time although my wife and I were pretty much on the same page with our kids if I just shut the hell up for 15 seconds when the kids were misbehaving she would respond and it was so interesting because her threshold for tolerating misbehavior was not very much different than mine it was literally say on average 15 seconds but because it was reliably she was reliably somewhat more patient that did mean that in some circumstances the bulk of the initial disciplinary moves fell to me so that's another thing that's interesting for that might be interesting for people to know too you might be closer than you think on the disciplinary fronts just one person's little quicker on the draw than the other and so it's about well sorry please go ahead it's just it's back to sharing values isn't it if you've got essentially the same values about how you want to bring your child up and how how your how you want your child to be in the world what you what your goals are for the way you raise a child then you can probably work those things out as adults together and yeah it's not as well so we could we we could lay out some of those principles and I think that would be useful for people who are watching so let's take that campaign Camp B we'll start with Camp a and that would be the more conservative side look it's really important that your children are popular and and welcome and that doesn't mean because they've sold their soul to the group it means because they can play fair and they're productive and generous and they know how to take turns and they don't whine too much when they lose and they don't Triumph too annoyingly when they win and they're good at reciprocity they're good play partners and that's really crucially important to kids the literature on the development of criminal Behavior anti-social behavior in children shows quite clearly that there's a subset of kids who are quite aggressive at the age of two most of them are boys most of them get socialized by the time they're four but some of them don't and the ones that don't start out there their sad little social lives as social Rejects and what happens is they fall farther and farther behind because the other kids start to play together because they can stand each other they they start to develop friendships and within those friendships they scaffold their social growth and so what that means is that if your child is unlikable at four maybe because you didn't help socialize them sufficiently between you and your wife then other children will reject them and then they're really in trouble and the literature I was familiar with indicated that if your child doesn't make a smooth entry into the social World somewhere between the ages of three and five there's almost nothing that can be done after that to remediate that it's such a serious problem and so one thing that parents could be aiming at is well this is why you don't let child your children do anything that makes you dislike them because you want other people to welcome them so you need they need to be able to modulate their behavior in a socially acceptable way so that's on the conservative side on the liberal side you'd say well you don't want your child just to be like a clone of the group you want them to have some individuality and some autonomy and so you might have to argue between you about what the balance is between those two things in relationship to your particular child because it needs to be particularized but um those are good aims an autonomous child who knows how to play well with others that's a pretty good deal for the child and for the world and for you as parents yeah and this is why when I research parent books parenting advice books and and I think the parenting advice industry has doesn't get enough scrutiny actually I I don't I'm not big I'm not a big fan of parenting books um but they tended to be either the kind of quite authoritarian or the quite liberal and you know and I in in my book I point out that actually there are good things about both there are necessary things about both as individuation and integration and you know both of those things have and so you take the bits from each model and you put them together because both of those are important and some of those um some of the advice in the more authoritarian books is good some of it I don't think is is good at all uh and the same with the other way yes it's important that children are individuals it's important that we listen to Children more than we use than we used to but what I've seen is it's the liberal parenting side that has um come into ascendancy over the last two decades and and that runs right across the um social spectrum of parents you get working class parents middle class parents are very liberal and I I think there's um and and I think most of the books are on that side and that creates a huge imbalance in sort of hoping that your child will become a fully rounded human being who feels good about themselves but also um fits into society but doesn't become a sheep or a cog in the world as you say um so I I think we have we have this huge imbalance for children that that doesn't make them happy and that what one of the things that I think is important if you want that sort of freedom for your your child that that you create a structure and you cannot really have freedom without structure because that's chaos and that's terrifying for children and um but but I think the whole focus is on this idea that children are born whole with a fully formed self um that it's the parents job to facilitate expression of that self and I think this okay so let's let's let's dig into that a little bit so you were concerned in in these statements about the Tilt towards a more liberal parenting so first thing I might comment about that is that being extremely liberal can also be a perfectly valid excuse for neglect because it actually takes real detailed attention to your children's Behavior to help them walk the appropriate social path and if you're not attending you let them get away with everything you can justify that by saying well what I'm doing is trying to individuate my child I don't want to put any social restrictions on them because that's all hemming in their natural pre-form perfect creativity and so and then you give yourself an easy out and that's that's not helpful hardly and that's partly also being driven by this idiot insistence that self-esteem is only internal and it's only psychological and that's an unbelievably pathological model of self-esteem and I would thank the social psychologists for that mostly because a huge amount of what your child would experience let's say as self-esteem which is actually by the way technically control of negative emotion isn't the consequence of the individuated nature of their psyche it's a consequence of the fact that other people can stand having them around without being mean and rejecting all the time so if you have a child who knows how to play by the age of three let's say and can share and isn't too whiny and isn't too triumphant and can reciprocate then you can send them off to daycare you can send them off to pre-kindergarten and they'll make friends and then when they go to school they have friends and the teachers like them and so they aren't suffering from the kind of negative emotion that people would confuse with low self-esteem but it's not because particularly because they're individuated or well integrated intra-psychically it's because their behavior is well regulated socially and so they integrate well into the community and so other people don't exclude and torture them and so it we really do have a warped and rusoian view of the way the children develop right is they're perfect in and of themselves except insofar as parents impose pathological parents in society impose pathological restrictions on them and it's as you said you pointed out another thing which is don't be confused in Freedom and chaos like if you give your children cartilage all that means is that their impulsive and anxious it does not mean they're free an optimally free child is actually playing a structured game now we know games are fun but we also know games run by principals they run by rules the rules aren't exactly there to constrain and hand in like you'd think if you were resilient the rules are actually preconditioned for a very complex sort of freedom and the basic rules of social interaction like reciprocity and not whining too much when you lose and not being too triumphant when you win those are the basic rules of social interaction and they actually facilitate Freedom rather than being antithetical to it men is it time to stop mindless scrolling time to finally gain that higher quality of life you know you're missing out on if this sounds familiar then on January 9th join thousands of men all over the world to embark on a 90-day journey together in search of a better life it's called Exodus 90 and it was built to help men enjoy the freedom of becoming who they were truly made to be Exodus 90 guides you in removing the attachments that are holding you back from a better life and it actually works independent research shows that Exodus 90 men report considerable shifts after the first 90 days including stronger satisfaction rates in their marriages more meaningful prayer lives and dramatic decreases in time spent on their phones for the past seven years Exodus has helped more than 60 thousand men build a road map for living with virtue in a culture that offers far too many paths to self-destruction is it time for your Exodus we start January 9th find resources to prepare for Exodus at exodus90.com Jordan that's exodus90.com Jordan hey it's Freedom um total freedom without boundaries is terrifying absolutely terrifying it is chaos and for for a child that you know that is terrifying but you all the child is always always pushing for those boundaries that the pair that they expect and I think children are born absolutely expecting the adult to know what they're doing to to um and and to guide them and and so they push to find out where that boundary is and that's the the little child's job really and if the parent doesn't provide that boundary then the child has to push further and further and further and come to a place that does not make them happy it makes them anxious um and uh and nervous so you you know okay so let's let's segue there then because that look that I'm going to tell you a little story here and then you'll see where I'm going with this very quickly so there's this individual in the Biden Administration in Washington and uh he's in charge of disposal of all nuclear waste in the U.S if I remember correctly now he's uh uh non-binary by public pronouncement he's bald often has a mustache wears pretty flashy dresses and uh has posted a fair bit of his sexual behavior publicly so you can find pictures of him for example splayed out on a slab bondaged up in rope all prepared for whatever activity he's prone to engage in there are pictures of him with men kneeling by his side with dog masks on like he's quite a bit of fun and so um you might save if you were skeptical that he's pushing the boundaries and he keeps pushing them and pushing them and and so far he hasn't found any boundaries because not only has he not been stopped in his public display of his impulse of Hedonism let's say but he's been highly rewarded because not only was he granted a very Plum government position which he may or may not have been competent enough to occupy but he also got a tremendous amount of publicity for it and then you might think well that's good enough you know he's those aren't he he didn't need to encounter any boundaries he was just pursuing his individuated creativity but then it turned out a month and a half ago that he he he stole a suitcase from an airport in Minnesota and it happened to be a suitcase full of women's clothing and then he happened to lie about it to the police and said that it was an accident and he got called out on the carpet pretty hard for that socially but he didn't get fired because apparently that even that wasn't pushing the envelope far enough and so then you know what that wasn't good enough for him he had to go to bloody California and steal another suitcase and get caught and this time he got fired and so so you talked about this bias towards liberal parenting let's say and you put that in the context of children pushing the boundaries and you put it in the context of anxiety so let's let's think of it this way children and adults can be overwhelmed by the complexity of the world and they want a structure like a game to hold back that complexity that's why you need routines in your household that's why you need predictability in terms of your caretakers that's why you need rules of the game it's so that things don't get out of hand now let's say that you adopt an extremely uh liberal parenting orientation and your children start to push the boundaries well you're not going to stop them and so that means they're going to push the boundaries harder and harder and that's going to make them more and more anxious because there's not enough structure and then let's say they hit teenage hood and puberty and maybe you're unfortunate you have a girl who hits puberty a little early and she's a little immature and she's little on the little sensitive to negative emotion maybe not quite as popular as she might be and she's quite confused and anxious and she starts pushing the boundaries pretty damn hard on the gender identity front and then you've got real trouble especially if she's also being exposed to a parcel of idiot teachers who are doing everything they possibly can to capitalize on her confusion and so it seems to me that what we are seeing in the Gen on the gender dysphoria front which is a form of social contagion and a psychogenic epidemic is an extension of boundary pushing Behavior it's so a girl can come up to her parent when she's 12 and and do a bunch of things at the same time she can say but I think maybe I'm a boy okay so what exactly is going on there well certainly a challenge to social Authority it's challenged to parental Authority it's an expression of a deep discontent and and and a level of chaotic anxiety and confusion and then it's also the only way as far as I can tell that the child can test the relationship between the teachers and their ideologies say gender affirming ideology and the rules that at home that the parents are trying to abide by because the kids at school are going to be taught look everybody's got a subjectively defined identity and you might not be as masculine or feminine as you've been led to believe and anyone who tells you different is a detestable bigot to such a degree that you should actually keep all of this secret and never even talk to them it's like how the hell is a kid going to sort through all that without going home and saying something like Mom sometimes I think maybe I'm a girl like because they're not going to be able to delineate this out in some complex philosophical manner adults can't bloody well do that and so sorry that's a bit of a rant but you can see where I'm going here well yeah I mean how can kids how can teenagers rebel against their parents anymore they they you know they can't be Goths they can't be punks they can't be Emos they can go into you know drugs and drink maybe but um it's it's the adolescent's job is to separate from the parents and we know that adolescents are far more influenced by their peer group than their parents and this is the Agony for parents because they're at an age where parents should be letting go should be um widening those those that boundary so that the child can push against the boundary of the outside world more as they take this journey which is from childhood to adulthood it's not any you know it's it's a rocky road for a lot of teenagers most I would say um and so so that pushing against the boundaries it part of that job is to reject the parents and protect reject the parents values and so we so parents of adolescents are even more um in a position where um they're tearing their hair out because they know that if if they're giving advice to their children that's not the advice their kids are listening to they're listening to the to what's going on in the peer group so it's a huge thing for society to have been put on to this generation of children and that parents feel helpless about and the parents job in adolescence is really to walk to tread that line and particularly in this area of speaking the truth giving their children facts that is a responsibility of parents and you may be the only person in that child's life who is doing that and it's also to allow the child more freedom and more freedom of expression so it's a real dance between and it's all about keeping up a good strong relationship with that child and keeping communication channels open right well in some ways you could think about the model you used which is say integration versus individuation is that as the child becomes more autonomous putting more stress on individuation makes more and more sense right because you've already laid down the groundwork for their social acceptance and then as they move into adolescence first of all they can't abide by your household rules entirely because they'd never leave home if that was the case right they have to have that drive towards independence and that's going to mean establishing their own system of values in some sense so that they can move away from you and do that autonomously and so they are going to be set against you in some real sense the problem is is that well I suppose part of the problem that parents run into at the moment is that the that's been weaponized that proclivity has been weaponized in the name of this this extremely strange gender ideology that insists that identity well we can take that apart a little bit that might be useful so one of the things that really strikes me as odd as a psychologist there's two things I suppose when I I look at modern claims about identity the first is that identity is subjectively defined I think that is so utterly preposterous I can't believe that we've we're even entertaining it as a culture it's so idiotic every single time I have a conversation with my wife or with anyone else for that matter but let's say with my wife I'm negotiating my identity just as she's negotiating hers because we have our viewpoints and our proclivities for action and we have our each of us have our tendency to insist that our way is the right way but if you're going to be around other people you have to constantly negotiate that so that you can stand each other and so a real identity is actually the ability to negotiate the transformation of your own identity in a social space it has nothing to do with you subjectively defining your identity so that's now the as far as I can tell the only people who are unable to negotiate identity and who insist upon having it subjectively defined are literally two years old because according to Piaget and and there's some good research support for the basic outlines of his theory two two-year-olds are two egocentric to negotiate a shared play Space so their identity is subjectively divine and they're almost entirely hedonistically oriented which means they run by whim which everyone knows if you're around two-year-olds and they can't play with other children okay so the idea that identity is subjectively defined is utterly preposterous and it's actually an anti-truth because if you try to Define your identity subjectively you are a bloody Tyrant and you're going to be an unpopular one too and you deserve it but then secondarily we have this other weird insistence and I I don't know why we've become so demented that we also accept this that your identity is subjectively defined but nonetheless the core element of your identity is some immutable group characteristic and the one we stress most is sexual attraction and I suppose the secondary one is something like race it's like so it's so peculiar that your identity is subjectively defined but it's also boxed into this very narrow set of parameters which is well the most important thing about you is who and to what degree to whom and to what degree are you sexually attracted like I that's just it just leaves me speechless well it doesn't but you get my point so I I think what we're saying is is the is this idea of subjective identity identity taken to its absolute extreme because you're right true you know up to two years old it amazes me how so many parent parenting books are based on building your child's self-esteem well sorry your child is born your child is only self-esteem nothing else you know they for their survival they have to be so it's not the adult's job to build the child's self-esteem as if that's something we can put on them it's part of your child's interaction with life with the environment we're in relationships that build self esteem so it might be achievement it might be yeah something that you can do something that you achieve and then you feel good about yourself it's not your parents always telling you you're amazing you're brilliant um and praising them and so and also that I that idea of the of identity it's the idea of the self this this thing that you're supposed to be born with and I don't know what myself is yet and I'm 63.

you know I'm going to I I don't know because it changes it changes according to circumstances I don't know if I'd be a great person to be uh on a Lifeboat with for example you know and and you know would I would I be the one that stood up and saved people helped save others would I or would I be so scared I don't know um I don't know myself and I don't believe there is a fixed self that we move through life with we're we're always changing according to to our circumstances and um and and our environment and perhaps we get to know ourselves a bit better but we can still fool ourselves we can still be dishonest about who we are to our to ourselves so that idea that child possesses this innate identity innate sense of self um it's one of the ways that we now well apart from the fact that it's it's nonsense we the position the roles have been completely reversed between adult and child so we are encouraged to see children as wise and as knowing themselves and um that we follow the child we follow you know you hear parents say oh I've learned far more from my child than they've ever learned from me well that's the wrong way around you know you you are the adult you are the one that's gathered life experience and hopefully some wisdom and again to put that respond you know that responsibility onto a child to be the the all-knowing um fount of wisdom and we do that to teenagers as well but when you look at the Adolescent years that identity formation becomes really the adolescent's job who am I so I'm not a child anymore I'm developing into an adult who am I what is and what teenagers do is they find their tribe and they find and they in in a way they they integrate before they can individuate because they find the tribe and they wear the same and they speak the same language and they like to say music or now YouTube videos and and the rules that you know we may mock this you know I've heard people mock it but it's it it's absolutely right that you know it's a stage of development and now the only tribe that you might describe as any kind of counterculture is trans having a gender and sexual identity and there is no other tribe that children can join to show that they don't conform or that they're a bit different or that you know it's it's it's it's only gender identity now so if you want to be um seen as boring and conventional and traditional and conservative and everything that a teenager doesn't want to appear to be they then you know you have to join that tribe and at least say oh I'm non-binary or I you know to to to be able to show that side of yourself unless you're really comfortable in the idea that you're that you're conventional and you don't have a problem with that yeah well that means that means that they've captured so and I'll go in two directions with regard to what you said years ago I did a study with uh colleague of mine at Harvard on when tattooing and piercing first entered the cultural scene and we were curious about whether that was a marker for Psychopathology or or what was predicting the adoption of these new fashion trends and what we found overwhelmingly was that it wasn't associated with an increased prevalence of mental illness it was associated with high trait openness and that's the creativity Dimension from the big five trait openness and when you see people with rainbow colored hair or you know multi-colored hair and piercings and so forth you're looking at people who are on the creative end of the distribution and the point you're making is in part that the the collapse of the entire domain of non-conformity into gender identity also entices the Creative Kids Creative Kids have more mutable identities too so they claim that well I'm a different person from day to day is particularly germane to Creative Kids because a creative person is quite different from day to day that's actually the definition of creativity and if you're creative and high in negative emotion that's even worse because not only are you mutable on the identity side that's actually your identity that mutability you're also very very volatile in terms of your moods and so the idea that identity is only mutable can be very very attractive to you now I also wanted to make a comment technically about self-esteem so I spent a lot of time analyzing self-esteem psychometrically because as a clinician I was extremely skeptical of the social psychological research purporting to indicate for example that there was even such a thing as self-esteem because we Bandy about these words but that doesn't mean they have a corresponding grounding in reality so I looked at and conducted Factor analytics studies which were designed to assess what exactly self-esteem was and it's quite straightforward and and people who are listening might find this extremely useful practically there's no such thing as self-esteem what there is is trait neuroticism which is proclivity to and to anxiety and pain essentially emotional and physical so people differ in their thresholds for being anxious and hurt and if you're more sensitive well then you'll see threats before people who are less sensitive and that can be useful and if you're less sensitive well then you're more robust and maybe more daring and that can be useful nope there's no way of saying what's right in that situation however if you're high in neuroticism if you're high in sensitivity to negative emotion you do experience a lot of anxiety and depression okay so self-esteem is basically neuroticism minus extroversion an extroversion is the positive emotion Dimension and so highly neurotic people so people sensitive to negative emotion are more likely to be self-conscious and to think negative thoughts about themselves but that doesn't mean that it's a fractured self-concept that's driving the negative emotion that's simply not true that negative emotional state is actually Baseline temperament you can measure it in infants you can measure it in kids that are six months old and you can ameliorate it to some degree if you have a child who's sensitive to negative emotion and you facilitate their exploration their autonomous exploration they can normalize their psychophysiology okay so first of all there's no such thing as self-esteem it's basically trait neuroticism and second you do not remediate trait and eroticism by getting people to focus on their feelings in fact making people self-conscious about their feelings makes trait neuroticism worse because there's no difference between being self-conscious and being high in trading or Autism so and then the the last part of all of that that's preposterous is you certainly don't remediate people's self-esteem you talk about this in your book with regards to over Praise by continually telling children how wonderful they are because what actually regulates their negative emotion to say it again isn't their internal psychological state or their attitude towards themselves it's whether or not other people like to have them around so if you have a child who's very popular surrounded by friends who's got a couple of best friends whose teachers respond positively to them who other parents respond to well who can regulate their behavior when they're out in public in a grocery store or restaurant so that adults are kind and smile to them the probability that they're going to experience negative excess negative emotion is tremendously ameliorated and so that's another strike on the conservative side like a a hit on the conservative side of the parenting Spectrum it's like you help make your children socially acceptable and you will increase their self-esteem you don't do that by giving them participation awards at school and falsely inflating their ego you don't ride an elevator for the music or choose an airline for their movie selection when it comes to audio entertainment it makes sense to choose audible

it it's it is bandaged around it it's part of parenting advice you know so much now but but really what what does it mean does it mean a sense of satisfaction with yourself does it mean because there is a a healthy you know I I guess there's there's like a healthy kind of confidence that you in in life but again I think that's so much generated by how you react with the worlds we're social creatures and if we cannot have or develop a positive relationship with the world and our environment and the people we meet and then then we're not likely to have a feeling of of kind of confidence in ourselves but I think you're right about the that there are there are innate personality characteristics or temperaments um and they can be tempered and they can be helped so that the child is um you get the positive side of that more than the negative side because with every temperament there is a positive and a negative and that what you want is to go with your child's character or personality and and and and and encourage the positive side of that more than facilitating the negative and maybe that's maybe that's the closest we can get to building your child's self-esteem well I talked to this psychologist a week two weeks ago Gene twangy and twangy is pretty good psychologist she's a good statistician she's good at Miss psychological measurement which is really important when you're dealing with the sorts of things we're talking about and for a long time on the self-esteem front there was this idea that positive affirmations for children were the way to self-esteem but that was dependent on the theory that your level of negative emotion was dependent on your attitude towards yourself something like that it was only a psychological variable but what twangy found was that all that false praise that devaluation of the currency of reward that over generalization of of uh insistence upon your child's singular wonderfulness at the expense of other people it didn't improve self-esteem what it did was inflate narcissism so then you got the best of both worlds you got kids that were just as miserable on the negative emotion front just as confused and anxious but they're also narcissistic and so that actually produced a bit of a spiral because you know it's it's it's a little bit more difficult to make friends if you're high in negative emotion because you're a bit more volatile you're a bit more sensitive you're also a little more timid in your social interactions so you already got a couple of things working against you now if you add a nice healthy dose of narcissism to that then you're going to produce a child who's unbelievably unpopular and dislikable because there's almost no one more dislikable than a neurotic narcissist that's a that's a tough combination too because you get that hypersensitivity along with grandiosity you might be able to tolerate one of those but man the combination of that's pretty damn unbearable and so all this idiot insistence on self-esteem through continual affirmation you know that would also be part and parcel of the elimination of competition in schools right because you don't want anybody to lose because God only knows what that might do to their self-concept and their self-esteem you produce this increase in self-centered narcissism and you make kids more isolated and miserable and lonely than they would have otherwise had to be it's a real Perfect Storm a lot of that can be laid at the feet of social psychologists by the way so doing very very badly thought through and analyzed research in clinical domains the Soho self-esteem bloody monstrous movement that that's one of the catastrophes that's emerged out of the research fields I I also think parents have encouraged have been encouraged to be therapists to their children to be counselors and what you mentioned earlier about feelings um this when I worked with parents it was constantly you know a child would come home and say oh somebody kicked me in the playground and the first question from the parent was not so what did you do about it or what happened but and how did that make you feel and like you know that that and how did that make you feel and how did you feel about that and and what it does is it gives power to feelings above actions and so you you get a child who then the child stops and thinks well how did I feel about it and it's usually you know sad or angry or happy you know this sort of very limited range of feeling words and uh and so then the child's thinking that's the important thing uh and it's always back to the child looking internally rather than looking outside and saying so this was what the situation was and then maybe if the child was uh being bullied or maybe if the child had a part in it we you know we listen to that we can you know perhaps help the child manage it better next time or maybe the child doesn't have a problem with it at all it's just sharing some information with us but if we bring that back every time to the child's feelings and the child is growing up thinking my feelings are the most important thing okay so so let's let's let's look at that so first of all we might ask what the hell do we mean by feeling and what we mean is something like immediate emotional response okay and then we say well feelings are Paramount we're also simultaneously saying immediate emotional response is Paramount okay so let's just think about that for a minute so let's say my wife says something that makes me angry all right so why aren't I just right it's like you just said something that made me angry now I'm angry my feelings are Paramount I'm angry I feel like hurting you let's say because I'm so angry why am I not right in doing that and why are we insisting to children that they're instantaneous emotional impulse is the appropriate marker for reality because the Alternatives would be well who cares what you felt about it what did you do about it or on the bullying front let's say what are you going to do about it independent of your feelings whether you're angry or upset or or looking for a fight or challenged whatever I want to know how you're going to cope with this situation actively so it doesn't occur again and then by walking through that let's say if you're talking to a teenager you're also privileging thinking over feeling and so then you might say well what is thinking and the answer is thinking and acting are what mature people replace feeling with so the only time we need to feel something especially on the negative emotion side is really when things don't go the way we want them to go so you feel forget about positive emotion for a minute you feel inconsequence of inadequate adaptation that's like a rule and so to privilege feeling means you're privileging inadequate adaptation and you're also saying well your first impulsive whim which is driven by these basic biological mechanisms that are very ID like in the Freudian sense they're not sophisticated At All by making them Paramount you raise them to the point of the highest virtue the highest virtue is what you feel and then it's even worse than that Stephanie because this is so awful it really is if you do careful linguistic analysis of communicative content one of the things and emotions let's say communicative content and emotion one of the things you find reliably is all self-conscious thoughts load on neuroticism so there is literally no difference between thinking about how you feel and being miserable they are exactly the same thing so what you're doing which is so into it's so sad right but you can you can kind of understand this if you think about self-consciousness so imagine you're on stage and you're delivering a talk and all of a sudden you get self-conscious what do you think self-consciousness is a good thing it's like no it's not you sweat you blush you stutter you forget what you're doing you collapse into yourself you get self-centered you don't pay attention to the audience you're no longer able to communicate and it can be a real catastrophe like people can get so self-conscious on stage that they develop a phobia of public speaking and that's all pathology of self-consciousness and so now what we do with our children at every bloody turn and they do this in school all the time well how are you feeling how are you feeling how are you feeling how are you feeling and the the other implication there and you talk a lot about non-verbal behavior in your in your book and how we communicate with children we're also telling our children all the time that if you feel bad anxiety let's say or some emotional pain that's so awful that that's all sensible and caring adults should ever care about and so what kind of message is that for children it's like oh my God you know you were upset at school what a cataclysm that is we we should probably restructure the entire social apparatus so that never even happens once it's so it's it's multi-dimensionally Preposterous and it's really hurting kids to make them self-conscious like that so I love what you say about self-consciousness and causing depression and and I mean it's you can see it so clearly in this idea that children or adolescents in particular now have this new um a childhood task of exploring their gender identity because what does that mean other than they must look at their every Behavior the way they like to dress everything that there was a book I read um which is about it's a workbook for teenagers on exploring your gender identity and basically you're looking at every aspect of your personality Everything About You in relating it to gender does that make me a girl or does that make me a boy and it's of course it's inevitably based on stereotypes it can't be anything else because because Boys Can't experience female things like menstruation and girls can't experience male things like erections let's say you know it's got to be stereotypes there's nothing else and you know one of these books that I read Because teenagers now there's a plethora of books including workbooks to help you along your gender Journey it's sometimes called a quest uh it's it's this sort of Adventure and and it was talking about Ben's in a river but each time you get to a bend in the river you stop and you think and about your gender identity well gender identity is a is a meaningless concept anyway it's it's it's not you know scientifically supported that we have this thing but it's it's a way to to get teenagers to constantly be looking at themselves looking at their um motivations and analyzing their actions which I think it's weird it will inevitably create mental health issues inevitably yeah well look look here's here's what it's analogous to okay so imagine that there are twists and turns in the in the bends of the river of your marriage and there are constant micro challenges and disputes that emerge in the course of the marriage okay here's the new rule okay every time you encounter any doubt whatsoever in your life question the Integrity of your marriage right okay so here's what happens to a depressed person so let's say you have a little bit of a dispute with your husband and uh it produces a little negative emotion and you think oh my God I'm always I caused some trouble that's the first thought I caused some trouble here's the next thought I've caused a lot of trouble in the past next thought I caused a lot of trouble in the present and I'm likely to continue to cause a lot of trouble in the future okay a person who causes a lot of trouble in the past present and future they're really not a very good person they're not really fit for a marriage they're probably not fit to live I should commit suicide okay so that's how a depressive person thinks now think about how that works so you go from a micro challenge if you have a little scrap with your with your wife and then you take yourself apart right down to the foundation and the foundation in that case would be do you even have the right to exist and so a depressive person has no defense against that Cascade of doubt okay so now imagine this is what we're doing to children we know that children establish the ability to distinguish between male and female extremely early they can do that as infants they can likely do it as newborns so that ability to distinguish between male and female is fundamental the reason it's fundamental obviously is because if you can't distinguish between male and female you're not going to reproduce so now we know not only is that true biologically but also conceptually it seems the case that the distinction between masculine and feminine symbolically is a distinction that's at the bottom of our ability to perceive as such we tend to make gendered categories in the world almost automatically so there might be no more fundamental perceptual category than sexual differentiation it might be more fundamental than up or down or darker light it's at least in the same domain so this is now what we're doing to it to teenagers when they're confused we're saying every time you manifest even a shred of doubt about anything the first thing you should do is question the most fundamental element of your being and you should do that continually and then it's even worse than that even though that's really bad because we're dooming them to something like anxious depression by doing that it's even worse than that because well let's say I've been reading about this uh like Demi I think it's Demi boy identity and sort of well mostly mostly you're a boy but sometimes you feel that you're a girl it's something like that or maybe I have it backwards I don't really give a damn to tell you the truth but here's the problem with that it's like let's say you have a non-standard gender identity okay what the hell are other people supposed to do about that like what are the rules here right because if you're a woman I kind of know how to treat you I'm going to do it in a stereotyped way to begin with because I don't know who the hell you are so I'm going to use you know low resolution approximations and those are going to be stereotypes they're no different than categories and then when I get to know you all particularize it but if I don't know whether you're male or female what the hell should I do with you you don't know because you don't know what the rules are and so the simplest thing for me to do is just not do anything with you the simplest thing for me to do is go find someone else who's a hell of a lot less trouble and who's willing to abide by the social norms enough so that they don't present a mass of indeterminate confusion on immediate confrontation and then you know the repost from the transgender side is well if you're a little more tolerant you'd know how to give me what I want it's like I don't have a bloody clue how to give you what I want what you want I have no idea I don't know how to give me what I want I can barely management with management with my wife I certainly have no idea what to give a bald man with a mustache in a red dress I have no idea what to do with you and neither do you no one knows the rules so we tell kids question your identity specify your non-binary orientation but then what like what's the life path associated with that how are you going to conduct yourself as an adult as someone who's non-binary are you going to get married how are people going to treat you at work what are you going to do with your kids how are you going to dress like you don't know the answer to any of those and neither does anyone else those aren't identities they're not identities they're they're masses of ideological confusion and that's all an identity tells you tells you and other people how to perceive and how to conduct yourself and man and woman boy girl male female is stable categories they're reality and to teach children any different to that is to T is to lie to children and to lie to teenagers and it's the most distressing thing for me to observe this going on that it's done in the name of kindness it's done in the name of compassion it's seen as the only legitimate way uh to help these kids and it's so cruel I mean I think you pointed out before you're you're what you're doing is you're affirming uh particularly a teenage girl's self-hatred and self-rejection and absolute hatred and disgust about being female you're affirming that and you're saying yep you're right to feel that way you know it's um you know reject let's kill off that person and let's replace that that defective woman where or girl with a boy and we agree with you the boy is so much better this is who you really are so the LIE there is like being a girl or a boy isn't who you are it's what you are it's just fact you know who you are is your personality is your past you know personality traits what you do whatever being a boy or a great girl isn't who you are but what it how it's sold to children and it's sold to children at the earlier stages I've counted as about 40 picture books for prime years now is that it uses the messages that are given to children now so be who you are be yourself um and the other you know when when to a child you know who who hasn't developed a self yet and it's not you know it's a lifetime's job in my experience but then also the other really strong messages you know who you are and nobody else has the right to question you now this is indoctrination from the early years onwards so age three as soon as children start kindergarten these books exist so what you're doing is you're taking away from that child or this generation of children the stability of reality and the the ability to differentiate between fantasy and reality at the most fundamental level of who they are and we the the way in this sense that we're tree we're we're now the children and they're the adults is is part of this message that parents are given your your child is born whole with a with a fully deformed I mean fully formed sense of self and so yeah my four-year-old boy he know oh she knows who she is you know it's not up to us to question that our child our child's wisdom um and you know the child is dependent on us as parents uh our job and we don't even see this as a job it's just automatic a child will say look Mommy there's a dog and we'll say yes it's a dog and we we can't or that's a dog no darling actually it's a cat we were constantly constantly reinforce our growing child's sense of what's real and what's not and we correct them if they make mistakes and we don't see that as a job it's just sort of automatically what we do with kids but that's what we're doing and then but in this case alone we're saying no that's you know you you you are literally a girl and we're approaching it as adults who are thinking I am affirming his gender identity not to the child you're not you're telling that boy he's literally a girl so for him he doesn't maybe understand biological sex yet but for him he's biologically female on the child's level of understanding a trusted adult is telling him he's he's a girl so he's a girl right and providing and reason for his confusion yes and no that's a terrible thing yeah also the fact that he has faced disapproval you know typically from the parents from one or other or both parents and perhaps from A Wider Circle for the toy choices he's making and and his friendships and so as soon as you say to him he's a girl and we get these sort of short-term honeymoon kind of results of you know increase he always suddenly he's really happy well of course he is because now all his toy choices are approved moved off by the adults and of course what he wants to do is win the approval of his parents that's what he needs to do for his survival so you've got you've got this terrible lie being told to children and you you you know and and I and I feel exactly the same with teenagers yes they're developmentally later on but it's exactly the same lie and it it had it it IT addresses true teenagers specific vulnerabilities of identity formation we'll be right back in just a moment first we wanted to give you a sneak peek at Jordan's new documentary logos and literacy I was very much struck by how the translation of the biblical writings jump started the development of literacy across the entire world illiteracy was the norm the pastor's home was the first school and every morning it would begin with singing the Christian faith is a singing religion probably 80 percent of Scripps memorization today exists only because of what is sung this is amazing here we have a Gutenberg Bible printed on the Press of Johann Gover science and religion are opposing forces in the world but historically that has not been the case now the book is available to everyone from Shakespeare to modern education and medicine and science to to civilization itself it is the most influential book in all history and hopefully people can walk away with at least a sense of that so there's no difference between being self-conscious and being miserable technically but here's something else self-consciousness among females is much more associated with body dysmorphia now the reason there's a bunch of reasons for that we don't know all of them but here's a couple first of all at puberty women start to experience more negative emotion on average than men and that it's not true of boys and girls but it does seem to it does seem to kick in at puberty and that's likely because you get size dimorphism developing and so it's reasonable for women to be a little bit more timid about the physical environment than men but also women are more sexually vulnerable and also they have to care for infants so being threat sensitive makes sense okay any in any case those are three possible reasons but it definitely kicks in at puberty now it also is the case that anxiety among women tends to take the form of bodily self-consciousness and I think the reason for that likely this is a speculation although the other the mere observation is a fact it's likely because girls and women are judged more comprehensively on their physical appearance than men so it makes sense that if they're going to be self-conscious it's going to be more bodily focused and then that's particularly rough then the third contributing factor is girls hit puberty earlier than boys so so now what you have a perfect storm there so now you have a girl and she's feeling a lot more anxious and confused than she did before because she hit puberty plus her body is doing 50 weird things plus she's getting all sorts of strange attention from adults that she never got before plus she doesn't know how to fit in on the social front and she's trying to make that transition from childhood to adulthood and so and then you have people additionally torturing about the fact that any deviation from the norm on the stereotypical front is actually an indication that she doesn't exist in the correct body well she doesn't really feel like she's in the correct body to begin with so it's a perfect storm for young girls so when Canada came out with its compelled pronoun law 2016.

I talked to the Canadian Senate I said you idiots in your legislation you think you're going to free up kids you're going to produce a psychogenic and epidemic among young women because they're preferentially susceptible to psychogenic epidemics which is why we had a bulimia epidemic and an anorexia epidemic all of which was spread by social media and a cunning epidemic and then there's a history of such epidemics going back 300 years I mean Freudian hysteria which was very widespread in the Victorian times although disappeared afterwards or mutated was also a psychogenic epidemic that preferentially affected young women and so well I just wanted to lay out some of the reasons why that's the case higher levels of negative emotion and more bodily focused self-consciousness and so then you add to that a kind of unpopularity because maybe a given girl isn't that sophisticated at manifesting what would you call it socially acceptable feminine traits because it takes a fair bit of sophistication to be a well put together woman and you're going to be pretty damn awkward at that if you're kind of a clunky tomboy when you're 12 and so well now you're providing them with first of all a unidimensional reason why they're miserable it's pretty damn convenient and no wonder adolescent wants that it's like do I have 50 problems or do I have one right and then you also entice them with the additional social status that they're going to receive by now announcing that they're special and having every bloody teacher in the entire world plus the World At Large focus on that narcissistic grandiosity that goes along with the insistence of a special identity and the only price you have to pay is cyclists the only price you have to pay is like enforced sterilization and surgical mutilation fine deal for our teenagers I I think there are another couple of things about teenage girls that we don't um pay as much attention to but the very fact of physical development in teenage girls means your body is sort of ballooning you know breasts here hips here bottom there um and you lose that sort of gender-neutral um body that gave you so much freedom in childhood and so what you how girls experience puberty is moving from being a free kind of person into being an object because suddenly her body is public property and as you say it it's commented on everyone has a right to comment on it um she may you know she'll get comments in the street she'll get she'll look all around her and become aware of the um objectification of women throughout Society now I think this is happening to boys much more that over the past decade in in the kind of certainly objectification of the male body and in some cases kind of sexual objectification of men um and this generation I used to seeing those really um exaggerated images of femininity so the feminine the female Heroes have actually huge breasts and Tiny waists and big hits Kim Kardashian yeah and the and and the male Heroes and you see have a ripped with a six-pack and they're hulks so you get that in gaming you get it in you know it sort of programs like love Island which I don't know whether you have in Canada um it's all about how you look so it's happening more for men and and interestingly boys experiences of things like um anorexia have increased but not as much as girls so girls are in a real you know the Gap is still widening also the emphasis and that that pressure also comes on women younger not only do they have puberty younger but also you know on average cross-culturally women prefer men who are four years older and what that also means is that men prefer women who are four years younger and what although most of that's driven by female Choice by the way but not all of it but it also means that women come under sexual pressure in some sense earlier than boys do partly because of earlier onset of puberty but also because there's a tighter relationship between biological fecundity and youth in women than there is in men and so that piles on the additional pressure for for young women so there's an overvaluation of female sexuality in some real sense that kicks in around the age of 13 and the advantage to that I suppose is all the attractiveness of Youth and Beauty but the disadvantage is well there's a hell of a lot of competition and judgment that goes along with that particular contest and certainly that does pile on a 12 year old girl well with overwhelming Force especially when you also add to that the fact that women are much more vulnerable on the sexual front in some real sense because they pay a much bigger price for well for sexual misbehavior let's say than men do given the risk of pregnancy that's a good definition of what is a Woman by the way a woman is the human being that bears disproportionate responsibility for reproduction it's a good biological definition too and you're stuck with that right you encounter that face first when you hit puberty as a woman and it's the constant I I think dilemma for women individual women and for feminism how to put those two things together because you're right we have the biological responsibility that may that men don't have and along with that I think the disgust with the female body is quite is pretty much tied into that because it kind of makes you an animal um and and you're reduced to your biology and so girls at puberty apart from not being developmentally ready to face all of this ego sexual harassment I mean it's in schools now there's there's an epidemic of sexual harassment in schools and not that girls should ever be ready to face that but you know they're they're so young and they can develop breasts at primary school age 11 and suddenly they are supposed to be a woman when they are still emotionally a child and how hard that is but also going back to the absolute female facts of menstruation how disgusting is that you know that that's the real um issue here of of developing um sexually as female you bleed I mean it's disgusting it is horrendous for for girls you know or not not all girls you know but it it it's one of the things I think that happens that pubic minimum it's a challenge it's a challenge and it can be really embarrassing and humiliating it can create anxiety and worry it can create you know pain and and feelings of real discomfort and and all the associated physical effects that go with it which boys don't experience so boys will get taller and broader and it's kind of everything that they were were before just sort of gets bigger but more but more yeah whereas with girls completely changed it suddenly oh I'm swelling out here and I'm swelling out here and my body's out of control and if you've got an image of yourself as being intelligent maybe even intellectual bit different all of those you know it can be so humiliating to feel actually no I'm just an animal I'm just a piece of meat my body will go on doing this and I have no control over that at all that can be really frightening and it can be so all of this now what is awful now is that we don't look at girls even though there's this massive you know 75 teenage girls going being referred to gender clinics we don't look at them as teenage girls because of course that's transphobic and this this um lack of a differentiation between male and female means that they're all lumped together as trans kids and all of the issues are seen as the same and we know in medicine that the female body and and women are not you know looked at properly anyway but this is really exacerbated that problem that we're not looking at gender dysphoria in girls even to say that girls is transphobic but we're not looking at it within a framework of of female adolescent health and the all of the other issues that helps us move into a domain that maybe we can cover just as we bring this to a close you've written a fair bit too about what what I would characterize I don't want to put words in your mouth as the absolutely pathological Stampede of idiot medical and psychological professional organizations to insist upon gender affirming therapy so as a therapist I'd like to point something out which is the last thing I'm ever going to do for any of my clients to come when they come and see me is affirm their identity that is not my job my job is to listen to my client and help them understand their current identity and develop it in the direction that appears most appropriate as a consequence of the course of our discussions so I presume people come to see me because they're miserable for one reason or another I don't know why they're miserable it might be terrible circumstances it might be something they brought upon themselves it might be some combination of both but I certainly don't presume to know and that's in some real sense a disturbance and identity and then what the therapeutic realm is is a place to explore the vagaries of identity now I'm not there to affirm my clients identity nor to deny it right I'm supposed to be there as a neutral ignorant listener it's like you're complicated I don't know who the hell you are what's wrong with you we're going to lay out a space of honest communication and try to develop a differentiated model of your identity and then try to optimize it now then you get this insistence now that the professional colleges have brought in which is no matter what your client tells you when they you first encounter them you have to agree with that or you're unprofessional to the point where your license can be reasonably not only reasonably suspended but should be ethically suspended and I look at that and I think oh well the whole therapeutic and most of the medical establishments just done if I have an anorexic girl come in to me and say I had an anorexic client once very thin girl as you might expect she wasn't very big and uh I had her sit by me at one point I said look at your thighs and now you look at mine and you tell me which one's bigger she said that hers was and I said okay fair enough so this is what we're going to do I'm going to put a piece of paper under your thigh and I'm going to have you trace it and then I'm going to put it under my so and I'm going to do the same thing and I want you to watch so you see I'm not playing any tricks okay so we did that of course my thighs are about that much bigger on both sides than hers and I swear she looked at that piece of paper for 20 minutes now she trusted me by this point eh so she knew already that I wasn't playing tricks but she still couldn't believe her eyes and I think the reason for that is that I don't think that anorexic women can see their bodies properly they lose the ability to see the Gestalt and they focus on in detail and then they can't distinguish between what's fatty and what's bone let's say literally they can't see it and so but I wouldn't if an anorexic girl came into my office and said you know I feel that my thighs are too fat I wouldn't say well if you feel that you must be right and it would be inappropriate unethical of me to suggest otherwise I would say well maybe you want to explore that maybe you don't I don't know if you have any doubts about it I don't know if this concern is causing you trouble I don't know if other people are reacting badly to your insistence that you're too fat still those are things we could discuss I can't say no however you feel is right and certainly on the sexual identity front or the gender identity front exactly the same standards apply so those are even more fundamental categories than thin or fat so I just think it's the death of the therapeutic Enterprise altogether so and an unbelievable cowardice and lies on the part of the professional organizations and it's presented as conversion therapy to do anything other than a firm a child's self-diagnosis and self um prescription of treatment um and again it ties into what's what's happening in parenting whereas I I think it's a good thing that we listen to Children more now because children weren't you know when I was growing up children really weren't listened to at all um and that's good but listening to a child seems to be interpreted as agreeing with the child on everything so if you know a therapist's job is to listen there's a lot of listening in in you know um counseling or therapy but it doesn't mean agreeing and we you know so we give up our knowledge our perspective um our knowledge of facts in order to placate or appease or in somehow uh in the misguided way thinking that we're building the the self-esteem of the other person but we don't you know that's never helpful certainly you know long term that's not a helpful thing to do we could also point out and should that all therapy is conversion therapy right the whole bloody point of the therapeutic process is transformation now you could say well you shouldn't convert the client into a clone of the therapist's presuppositions and that's definitely true what you want to do you know when I saw my clients the first thing I would try to find out is okay what why are you suffering how and why are you suffering and that's really complicated I could take hundreds of hours to figure out because maybe it's a psychological Quirk or maybe it's a catastrophe of situation and God only knows how to differentiate those so you have to listen a bunch so the first is well how are you suffering and why and then the next is well if you had your way and you could Envision things being better well what would better mean for you and how would you envision that practically and so that's on the client right you don't want to interfere with that because like you can you can offer your opinion you can say how you've seen other people solve that problem but you don't want to muck about with that too much because each person has to come up with a somewhat particularized solution to that problem I don't know what your life would be like if you optimized it for you you know in your particular situation so we have talk about that a lot and then the third thing we do is talk about strategy you know now we kind of know what the problem is we have some sense of what might hypothetically be a solution we could delineate out potential strategies for achieving it but all that's predicated on discussion and none of that has anything to do with affirmation except I guess what you affirm as a therapist is you affirm the utility of honest communication and you affirm the idea that through honest communication and inquiry positive conversion is possible Right conversion towards some more ideal state of being very difficult thing to manage but you certainly don't do that by privileging your clients feelings Above All Else and then by being terrified into Silence with regards to the responses you might have to an inquiry so it's really it's really something to behold you know when you you talk about the role of compassion in that hypothetical compassion you know one of the things I see continually poor parents say the people the claim is being made constantly that unless you give way to your child's desire to transition they're they're going to commit suicide and would you rather have a trans child or a dead child that's a question that's often asked to parents okay so I want to take that apart for a minute number one even the bloody American Psychological Association which has become a very pathological organization admits in their in their documents of affirming care and they do this by pointing to Prejudice there are no good long-term follow-up studies on the life course history of trans individuals and then they say well that's because of prejudice against trans individuals and be that as it may I don't care about that at the moment there are no long-term studies so how the hell do you know that you're elevating or decreasing the suicide risk and the answer is you don't know and that's a lie and second we know perfectly well that most of the kids most people who have who manifest any form of Psychopathology have a core set of symptoms and those symptoms are basically elevated negative emotion anxiety and pain so anxiety and depression you don't have a mental illness except for maybe Mania where anxiety and pain aren't part of it okay so then the question is if there is a risk for suicide associated with gender dysphoria is it specific to the gender dysphoria or is it merely a consequence of the fact that all forms of Psychopathology are associated with anxiety and depression and suicidality is associated with anxiety and depression and the answer is unless you have compelling evidence that it's specific to gender dysphoria then the appropriate thing to do scientifically is to assume that it's a consequence of anxiety and depression and quit riding vulnerable parents with guilt so well so for those of you who are watching and listening and struggling with these sorts of things don't let idiot teachers and counselors tell you that by objecting to your child's gender dysphoria you're elevating the risk of suicide because that is a lie there is no evidence to support it but the claim made is that your child is more likely to commit suicide if they are not affirmed and and allowed to go into puberty blockers that's the claim there's there's no evidence to support that at all um parents can be supportive in lots of different ways but parents are being bullied in the cruelest way imaginable to affirm their child and go into this medical pathway so this you know and they kind of contain you the thing is now that not only parents but all young people know that part of the Persona part of the rules of the tribe of being transgender are having suicidal ideation you know that's part of make what makes you true trans so it's the most irresponsible I I cannot understand why the Samaritans hasn't spoken out about it why I you know government ministers have not spoken out about it we know about the um contagious possibilities of this of suicide we know the dangers of saying suicide is down to one factor we we know that and yet we let this carry on in this area and this is where you know this is the these are the kind people yeah well this is okay so let's close up with this so I've been thinking recently that our conceptualizations of narcissism are too one-sided I think we concentrate on grandiose narcissism sort of more masculine form of narcissism more than we concentrate on the more feminine form of narcissism and I think the female the feminine narcissism is something like narcissism of compassion and that's associated with this idea the Freudian idea of the edible mother who what would you say Fosters a sense of hyperdependence the helicopter parent now males can do that too but but it's more likely to occur on the female side because females are more agreeable and they are more compassionate so the reason that we're I think part of the reason that no one is speaking out against that while you are and I have and there's a few people who are but but the reason that you get slaughtered so badly if you do is because the narcissists of compassion come after you and they say well it isn't like you care for children you're just mean we care for them so much that we'll listen to them no matter what we say and then the underground message there isn't we're doing best for children the underground message is look how much we care don't we deserve to have our social status elevated merely on that grounds and maybe right to the highest possible point we're so compassionate that we're mother Mary herself right it's nothing but the Mother of God's voice talking here and so anybody who is who is antithetical to that broad scale and all-encompassing compassion is instantly what deemed an agent of Satan for all intents and purposes and but it's so absolutely I saw this woman so she was a Disney executive and uh she was testifying if I remember correctly when Florida was clamping down on Disney and she said she was the head of their domestic programming something like that she said well I have a trans child and a pansexual child and one's five and one seven and I thought okay let's just think about that statistically for like one tenth of a second the probability that you have a trans child is one in three thousand before the gender dysphoria epidemic hit one in three thousand okay what's the chance that you have a pansexual job now I have no idea what the hell pansexual means but I know that whatever it is it's rarer than transsexual so at minimum you have a one in three thousand chance that you have a pansexual child so what's the probability that you have a pansexual and a transsexual child and the answer is one in nine million so here's the question are you a pathological narcissist of compassion well what are the odds 899 999 no no it's 8 million 999 999 to 1.

that's the statistical that's the appropriate statistical analysis for that claim so no I don't think you have a trans child and a pansexual child I think you are a devouring narcissist and you are willing to sacrifice your own children to your narcissistic pretension to evaluate your to it to what Elevate yourself in the social hierarchy with no work merely by claiming that you're that loving that's you God it's so awful it's it's almost indescribable and I think that's partly that there is enormous pressures on mothers to be kind and nice and to be um ever nurturing ever compassionate ever kind and the other that is the archetypal mother the nurturer The Protector but the other side of that is is is um pushing away um um rejecting um it's you can say it's the shadow side but you know as young said if you don't integrate the shadow side it'll come up and bite you and actually if you know you look at other mammals they bite their young if they're trying to cat you know get hold of the cheats and drink milk with you know and they're and then and the mother's annoyed and irritated and pushes them away or even bites them and we have to integrate that because it's all it and and make allowances that in ourselves that part of our job is is nurturing and holding close but it's also pushing away or allowing the child to move away and sometimes that needs a little push and that is fine right well well the psychoanalyst said very wisely I think this was Freud but it might have been young he said the good mother necessarily fails right so what you have and this is very hard on women and I understand this I really do I watch my wife go through it my wife is actually quite a disagreeable woman so she had less trouble with this than a more compassionate woman would have had this is not a criticism of my wife by the way so when a child is an infant so zero to six months you should be a hundred percent compassionate because the child is immobile and completely helpless and the rule there is whatever you feel is 100 correct but then as the child starts to become mobile maybe that kicks in you know essentially around nine months the mother has to do this terribly difficult thing of starting to separate herself from the developing infant and there is actually there's a real sacrifice in that and there there really is the I would say the integration of the Shadow side in that now the proper way to handle that the mature way to handle that is to think something like this if you're female to think look I did my time I I sacrificed myself for this infant that was entirely appropriate but I should have a life of my own I should pursue my own things I should pursue my relationship with my husband I should pursue my activities in the broader world I should facilitate my child's Independence and I should model for that child Independence and that means that the appropriate thing to do now is to move away from that extraordinarily bonded mother infant scenario to something that's more detached and focused on autonomy and competence rather than all compassionate love and that's you know the freudians and the unions were very very good at delineating out the shadow side of the devouring mother the best book on that I think is the great mother by Eric Neumann which is an absolutely terrific book details out the symbolic representations of the devouring mother and the devouring mother interestingly isn't the woman who pushes the baby away or the the infant away let's say and says you know go out and play the devouring mother is the one that holds the child far too tightly in her loving Embrace and will never let go so right that's the shadow side of that hyper compassion and we're seeing that you know that we might be seeing that partly I've never said this I don't think but it's only been 50 years since women have really been a force in the political world and we could assume that there's going to be a feminine Psychopathology that goes along with that just like there's a masculine Psychopathology on the male political side and you know the male Psychopathology might be narcissistic aggression something like that but the female psycho pathology could easily be devouring compassion easily and I do think that's we're seeing that play out in our culture now and God only knows what the consequence of that'll be I think that's what we're seeing in the gender identity movement um that as as women gain more power in Academia in politics um Etc you've got a combination of the sort of narcissistic entitled male which comes from the generally middle-aged cross-dressers that that you find in every organization and Company and political party these you know powerful man and on the other hand you get this over emotional illogical feeling based kind of support and from the women because because this movement is supported so much by young women and so you get you you get the worst of the feminine or the negative side of the feminine and the and the negative side of the masculine coming together because I think conspiring yeah yeah the marriage of the two I I I kind of naively thought wouldn't it be great if the world was run by equally men and women because that would balance the the you know the yin and the young and I don't I don't believe that a world weren't run by women would be more Superior than a world run by men but together but what if oh what if the negative side of man and the negative side of women come together and I think that's what we're seeing and on that note I'm not happy no okay so for everyone watching and listening I'm going to talk to Stephanie and up for another half an hour on the daily wire plus platform we're going to talk a little bit about how her interest in parenting and then her interest in the broader social uh what would you call ramifications of attitudes towards parenting how all of that developed and I do that generally with my guests something more biographical hello everyone I would encourage you to continue listening to my conversation with my guest on dailywireplus.com
