should accept yourself just the way you are what does that say about who I should become is that just now off the table because I'm already good enough in every way so am I done or something get the hell up get your act together adopt some responsibility put your life together develop a vision unfold all those manifold possibilities that lurk within be a force for good in the world and that'll be the adventure of your life and you know my my great grandfather was president of the University he's buried on their campus I mean I came from a my wife's uh mother Joanna was one of the incredible teachers in Oklahoma City in fact the quick story that's worth telling about that we're having one of these exhibitions I talked about and this woman comes up to me and we're in Austin Texas and she comes up and she said you know this reminds me of my eighth grade science teacher and she said I live in Oklahoma City I came to see this and it reminds me of her and she started describing this wonderful teacher who was Socratic and who did all the things and she said um she got finished and I said and her name was Joanna Anderson oh and the lady said how in the world could you have known that and I said because that's her daughter Laura and the woman just started crying and she said that lady changed my life right so adults have an important role to play in a child's life yeah that role shouldn't be to be an authoritarian you know having order to sit at a desk where a bell rings every 45 minutes yeah that's not the teacher's fault that's the system right it's the system now you're participating in the system yeah but I always try to do you know I try to divide the teachers are often the heroes and sometimes not the system's the problem and I don't think there's anyone who doesn't think the system is broken hello everyone I'm pleased today to be speaking with Jeff Sandifer who's someone I've known for a number of years and worked together on a variety of projects um we're going to talk today about childhood education and about his background depending on which platform you're viewing Jeff is an entrepreneur and a Socratic teacher which is a teacher by the way who tends to ask questions rather than provide answers he began his first business at the age of 16.

then trained as an engineer and then went on to graduate from the Harvard Business School he has started and run many successful businesses the most recent of which is Sandifer Capital Partners an oil and gas investment firm with several billion dollars in assets he's also started multiple academic programs in schools I'm going to concentrate on that today such as the Acton School of Business whose students were named the most competitive mbas in the nation by the Princeton Review he's extended this work over the last 15 years into the K-12 Realm kindergarten through grade 12 with the Acton Academy a Cutting Edge program that blends the one-room schoolhouse the Socratic method and 21st century technology to Aid each student in changing the world themselves and the world so Jeff we get a chance to sit down and talk today and to share that with a very large number of people so it's we're we Jeff and I were talking before this podcast about what we wanted to talk about and last night we thought about construing this in terms of educational reform but really the proper way to set this conversation up is to talk about education not so much reform but education per se and so let's start a little bit by talking about your background though and we might as well go back to I guess your your your early experiences in in early adulthood and let's lay that out and then we can we can we can place in the educational discussion as as appropriate sure and I you know I I think as you say today that I'm here more as a father and a husband you know than than um an educator or even a Socratic teacher but I really started live um as an entrepreneur uh age 16 I had my first real business we made a hundred thousand dollars in profits which as old as I am back then that was real money um by age 26 I'd taken a million dollar investment and within four years turned it into 500 million dollars in profits so what was your first business uh oil and gas exploration F-16 yeah 16 we were actually painting uh tanks out in the hot west Texas Sun and my father had had me working in the oil field as a laborer and I didn't want to do that anymore um so I found I could hire the high school football coaches at our local high school and instead of paying uh workers by the hour I paid them by the job they hired their football players underneath them and their productivity was nine times higher than the average uh than the average Cruise so we went out and competed charged two-thirds with our competitors charged and had 80 percent profit margins so why were they more efficient uh because they were getting paid by the tank by what they did you had the incentives and so they would show up at the you know Break of Dawn and work till dusk who the people who were being paid in those days two dollars and fifteen cents an hour had no incentive to work hard so it was just purely incentive work ethic uh you can imagine football players and coaches or conscientious yeah yeah and so um you know it was a home run why did they take you seriously when you were so young I think because if you think about coaches during the summer they had nothing else to do what do they have to get a chance to work with their team too right and what do they have to lose right they're not doing anything anyway so it was kind of one of those things where you could put together uh pieces of a deal to make the pipe bigger for everyone right right and it just worked it's exciting to give people an opportunity to to experience a direct return on their immediate investment I mean one of the things that's nice about Hands-On labor carpentry and and yes and Contracting so forth is you immediately see what you produce and the harder you work the more there is of it and so yes obviously you built those incentives in and so then you you you you took that money and you further invested it you said you into something that generated a million dollars and how did that happen well I actually didn't went off and got an engineering degree I went to Harvard Business School and then when I got out of Harvard Business School I raised a million dollars and we went out and we drilled the oil and gas wells in the Gulf of Mexico and you know through hard work a lot of luck good timing we turned that million dollars into 500 million dollars in profits in four years for our for our investors and our employees and ourselves and so I'm at now age 29.

I've got more money than I'll ever spend I don't spend much money yeah I'm a cheap guy yeah yeah what do I do next and so um I decided to take a year off to become a Socratic teacher in lead case discussions at the University of Texas MBA program and that changed my life and so for 35 years now I've been uh going on 40 years I've been a Socratic teacher okay so let's let's define that for everyone sure so Socratic teacher and this case method yes so let's go into what constitutes a Socratic teacher first so um you're put in the shoes of someone facing a real-life dilemma where there is no right answer their moral choices you're going to have to trade off efficiency and money and what you want to do with your life and then you uh you've worked maybe 10 hours preparing this case this 10 to 100 page case might be about Enron uh might be about acting academy we have a Harvard case about Acton our school and then it's Mr Peterson you're not a doctor then you're going to be younger uh Mr Peterson what would you do invest or not right and so you then you have to make your case their counter cases and you know the Socratic method is interesting the way we practice it there's only two questions would you do a or b next right right and then the second question is what do you mean by a yeah it's definitional so the entire Socratic method is just helping people understand what to do next and why and when you say what you're going to do exactly what are you going to do right so it's the interrogation of a story so yes the thing about a story that makes it that makes it unique is that it it provides a deeply contextualized representation of something complex yes and you see this happening in a court case when we're trying to decide whether someone is guilty or innocent really what we do is set up a dialogue between competing narratives yes right and so the defense Bones the defense narrative and the prosecution amounts of prosecution narrative and then what you're attempting to do is weigh the narratives yes now using the Socratic method as well as you pointed out you're going to be asking people questions and getting them to inquire after definitions and then you said this is very strategically oriented so it has to produce a binary outcome a decision related outcome yes with the strategy associated with that yes in in psychotherapeutic practice one of the things you learn very rapidly pretty much all therapists of any school of repute who are well trained know this is that you can't really give people advice about what to do you have to ask them to delineate out the problem you have to ask them to lay out what they might see as a solution and you can interrogate that and then encourage them to step through all the intermediary uh steps towards the solution and I think the reason that works is that unless people walk through all of that if they're just delivered the prepackaged solution they actually have a no idea how to implement it but also no real motivation to implement it yeah there's no there's no drama to it there's no part of life I mean something I've learned from listening to you you know about the power a story you don't have any of that and also for the real world there's no action I mean there are consequences eventually you're going to go out and do these things yourself and and I think I was a straight A student and you know a good student when I was younger but it was all about learning to know and so this method is more about learning to learn what are the routines and the recipes that we go through learning to do something that requires courage and then that leads to learning to be who you're going to become yeah well it seems to me like it's something like an analysis not so much of much of what the facts tell you the next step should be because you never really get to that point it's more like a delineation of the principles by which you're going to operate and an exploration of what principles you're willing to put Faith in and I would say the reason I would use the language of faith is because you have to LEAP into the unknown absolutely right and so you want to be informed while you do that but but you don't have the data at hand and you won't until you run the experiment right so and so where were you doing the case studies well so I learned the method at the Harvard Business School and then I took that in my own exploration of trying to figure out what to do with my own life and it age 28 was teaching a room full of 28 year old graduate students at the University of Texas and so that was and you know as you said what you're doing if you do a hundred cases you're seeing pattern after pattern after pattern much like the stories you might see in the Bible and you're learning through these patterns and to have the courage to then go do it yourself as you point out in the face of of uncertainty yeah well you know you're doing something that that brought up two ideas for me one is well you're exposing yourself to a number of a diverse number of cases right yes and then what you're doing you do the same thing that these Advanced language processing models do yes you're looking for commonalities across the narratives and as you gather more and more narratives within a certain domain you you start to understand the underlying principles yes so this is what happened in the book of Exodus by the way when because before Moses uh is has the Commandments revealed to him he sits for an unknown amount of time Dawn till midnight every day judging the Israelites and their complaints and so we hear thousands and thousands of cases right and then you can imagine that the Revelation is the it's the revelation of the substructure of what constitutes Justice itself yes and but you can't get to that without this case analysis so why with all the money at your disposal and the hypothetical Freedom that that might have um bestowed upon you yeah why did you decide to well stay actively working stay actively employed now you were a professor at utexas yes I was an adjunct you're an adjunct in the business school in the business school okay but and so you decided to continue doing that and what was driving you in to do that because I was fascinated with asking questions and and you know the the difference from a Judicial setting and the way we practice the case method is in the judicial setting eventually a jury or a judge is going to decide what's right in our sitting it's the actor themselves playing out the act so I was fascinated and frankly I didn't know what to do with my own life I mean I had first started my first business to get out of the hot sun I started the second business so I could make more money than my father I wanted to overcome him oh yeah yeah but then I did that and it's like you're 28 what next right I didn't know so I went to actually learn myself and by you know asking questions and digging in and then were you ever tempted on the hedonistic front I mean you're pretty young at that point you have the world at your feet in some real sense so well I'm not exactly Brad Pitt so I don't think the hedonistic part of chasing girls well no it doesn't help it does help apparently didn't help enough but yeah but no no I just never was interested the hedonistic thing just didn't didn't really appeal to me um well I had a father who I loved dearly but he was rich one year and broke the next but always lived as if we had money and there was something about that I didn't like now I'm sure there's something our children don't like about me so that's a typical father or son yeah you know judging it but but I think that that um it set up something in me that I've always been more about competence than Prestige and so chasing Prestige to me just never felt right and so the hedonistic Roots uh would have felt Prestige overcompetence is narcissism yeah so so I just so so I just that just didn't wasn't appealing but I was lost and so how long lost when I was lost at 29.

uh people only ask they're only desperate when there's no hope and they hit rock bottom yeah or you get to the top and you ask is that all there is right so I'm at the top and I have to ask is that all that is it all there is and I said I don't know what to do except to go socratically explore with a group of us right well that's that's a good thing if you're if you're somewhere and you don't know what to do exploring seems like a good idea right it is definitely the case that the the only genuine Pathway to exploration is something like the pursuit of the questions that honestly plagued you yeah right and so you know and there's a destiny in that too that's extremely interesting because a different set of problems plagues each individual yes right so you're going to have doubts everyone does but you're going to have your doubts and the strange thing about your own doubts is that your doubts contain the seeds of your progress yes because if you pursue those doubts first of all they're stopping you because they're doubts if you pursue them and you and you Rectify them then you're going to find a pathway forward but you can't do that without honest questioning well and and to to foreshadow what will happen later you know this set up everything that uh my wife Laura who really gets credit for the schools we've built but it sets up everything it's the hero's journey story right it's Pilgrim's Progress it's the hero going out looking for the Grail fighting dragons and monsters and then you realize when you get to the end it wasn't about the Grail at all that's how the hero changed in the process and so it really began to set up that pattern over and over and over again right Eternal transformation right as a consequence of learning you know one of the things I've I've thought about Joe Rogan a lot because Rogan's success on the media front I would say is unparalleled yes he has the number one podcast in a hundred countries wow right it's not there I think he's the most significant media figure who ever lived possibly in terms of sheer numbers and breadth of reach and he runs a shoestring operation it's really just him and his producer he picks all his guests and all he does is ask them the questions that he actually has and and what's so interesting about that is well it's made Joe an incredibly well-informed person I mean yeah because he's I think he's done it's some thousands of podcasts now so he's had thousands of hours of case studies let's say but he also can bring his listeners on the same Journey because yes the probability that he's asking an honest question that that will be a question that resounds with his audience is extremely high and it's so interesting to see how much power there is in that is that his stripped down approach which also requires virtually no editing and certainly no special effects his stripped down approach is the most compelling approach and I think it is because it's based on an honestocratic owner Socratic method but it does require curiosity and it requires a genuine interest and and true choices and one of the hardest things is Socratic teacher is if you you never ask a question you know the answer to it has to be an equal balanced question it has to be fair right and so if you're trying otherwise putting your thumb on the scale the other person immediately will know it and so I when I've listened to to you on Joe Rogan and Rogan's podius he's incredibly good at listening and asking a very honest question yeah there's no and people would spot it if he was absolutely yeah here's the deal the government keeps raising rates because it's the only tool they have to keep inflation under control and it's not working you can't spend your way out of inflation you've seen the impact on the stock market and you've seen the impact on your savings hedge inflation by owning gold whether physical gold and silver in your safe or through an IRA in Precious Metals where you can hold real gold and silver in attack sheltered retirement account buy gold and get a free safe to store it in that's right on qualifying purchases from Birch gold group now through March 31st they'll ship a free safe directly to your door just text Jordan to 989898 to get your free info kit on gold and to claim eligibility for your free safe then talk to one of their precious metals Specialists that's Jordan to 989898 today there is an old a very old religious insistence that pride is a cardinal sin and that humility is the virtue that counters pride and then you have to ask well what does it mean what does humility mean and it means something like admission of ignorance yeah but what's so useful about that and why it's a virtue and why it's something very useful to practice is that if you do admit to your ignorance which is to note what you don't know and to dare ask it right then you immediately Rectify I told my daughter for example oh you know very straightforwardly um you only have to ask a stupid question once if you listen to the answer right so so she's been in many situations where you know she was in over her head like well like we all are yes very often like me today well and it is very tempting to pretend that you know and and to not ask the stupid question but first of all almost everybody around who's participating let's say in the conversation has the same stupid question and second if you don't ask it well then you remain stupid so that's not helpful and well well you know I think this was a great lesson of like a lot I've learned about about Parenthood and about having this same approach with your children I mean you know this and I've seen you with with Julian up close of you know being generally interested but offering choices and listening and caring as a parent and so you know I didn't have children at this point but I have a room for 28 year olds that are bright and we can explore life together in entrepreneurship and how you make money and what it means if you make money um and that ended up being I spent quite a time at the University of Texas we built up the entrepreneurship program we won all sorts of awards um and then spun off our own business school why did the why why was it well received do you think and and why did the why was it also two inch two things well received by the students but obviously it was also well received by the administration okay it was well received and you know enough about Academia the teachers so the professors who were teachers loved us what we did though is we had a very firm very hard contract of what was required to be in the class we graded on a forced curve when everyone else gave all A's the harder we made the program the more people we attracted yeah yeah and so but but at some point uh I think our teachers who were all entrepreneurs who had been successful so all adjuncts oh yeah one the teacher of the year award 11 out of 11 years which and how big a group was that well we for the uh there were 141 professors and our group of eight were teaching 25 of all the elective hours in the school as adjuncts wow as adjuncts and so being paid nothing yes so you can imagine what happens next in this story yeah right right so we're basically all fired we all quit depending on which story you want yeah yeah we go start our own school and we focus on what was this this would have been two thousand and what was I see and so that was after eight years yes eight years and what was the rationale for the firing slash quitting um probably that I was too disagreeable which was fair um but I will say I got a call from inside the school from someone and he said look a tinkered professor and he said look I have to tell you they're going to fire half of you this summer and the other other half um at Christmas because and we were at that point attracting more than half of all the students to the school and teaching a quarter of them and they said they just you know the the tingered political faculty just doesn't want you here so we decided we were going to teach one last class off campus across the street from the campus and um 130 people showed up for no credit they drove credit they drove from Waco from Houston to Austin from Dallas to Austin so they came from all over including faculty from those schools and we thought you know what maybe we should have our own MBA program right now we knew nothing about that that was impossible right no one ever told us you couldn't get a credit but we managed to build a program we ended up winning all sorts of awards from Princeton Review with really Navy Seals Olympic athletes and young entrepreneurs and we built this hundred hour a week 10-month program that was just brutal but changed our lives and changed the lives of the students so that was right after you were at the University of Texas yeah yeah we were fired and it was right the next thing we did was have this free class and the next thing after that was launch our own NBA program and so what was the rationale for dispensing with you guys I mean it must have been somewhat difficult given the fact that well it was half the students it was very popular yeah there was an outcry but as the dean put it to the students at that point you are not our customers our customers are the pursuit of scholarly knowledge and so your opinion doesn't really matter was what they were told so anyway we spun off it was successful it was a lot of fun um and really I'm I'm now you know still doing some business things mostly teaching this program's a lot of fun and then we come to kind of one of the most important things in my life and that is um our two young boys are in Montessori School and they're just about so you had them after you left the University of Texas and started this now independent program right so this is didn't have accreditation for the independent program we did get accreditation we did we managed to get accreditation because we won all these Awards and they had to give us accreditation who who awarded you accreditation uh sex we were we had sex accreditation through a small University that my great-grandfather had been president of at the turn of the century and sax is oh the southern accrediting Association so it's one of the regional accreditors right you got associated with a small college but it didn't matter because as long as you have accreditation right do you have accreditation right right right and so accreditation was set up so that well so that in principle so that there was some what would you say consistency reliability and validity to the SI nation of a of a degree I mean that's the theory that's the theory what it really serves as of course is a protection of the cartel right I mean it's not really that but we managed to get it wasn't an issue um and and you know we built the program by the then I've got these two children Charlie and Sam and they're about to leave from Montessori to get ready to go to elementary school so I go to see the very best teacher and the very best middle school in Austin that's teaching our daughter who's older and I said when should we move the boys into a regular school and I'll never forget this this gentleman was an African-American he looked like Abraham Lincoln tall stately you know very one he and he said as soon as possible and I said well why and he said well once they've had that kind of Freedom they won't want to be chained to a desk for eight hours a day and talk to them so we get them in get them in Chains Young and I I was kind of stunned and I said well I don't blame them I just blurted that out and he looked down at the ground for the longest time and he looked up and he had tears in his eyes and he shook his head very quietly and he said I don't either so I went home that day and I told Laura I said I don't know if we're going to homeschool I don't know if we're going to start a school but our boys are the best teacher in this town just told me not to put them in Traditional School so we're going to do something else do you know Paul Gotti no okay Gotti I hope I have his name right he was a teacher of the year in New York state a number of years and he wrote he died unfortunately I wanted to interview him but that never was never possible he was no uh admirer of the current education system let's say and he wrote a history of the education system which was extremely interesting he pointed out that the public education in the in the United States I was investigating this because I was wondering why our school systems are so bad at fostering individual Vision yes because it's such a lack I thought why this is such a lot there's something going on here okay depressions established the first public education system and the reason they did it was because the Prussian Emperor wanted to produce obedient soldiers you know disciplined obedient soldiers no I don't want to get cynical about that because in a society that requires a military disciplined people who can follow rules are arguably necessary now obviously that can go very badly right but but we've got to give the devil is due and the oppressions actually put forward a very effective military training system now that was adopted in the United States in the late 1800s by industrialists mostly self-proclaimed fascists so at that time of course it wasn't Mussolini Hitler like fascism it was far the early precursors of that but they were people who believed that the state and the uh the corporate world could integrate at the highest levels and there might be some utility in that which is a very dubious claim nonetheless so they noticed that they knew that all sorts of rural people were pouring into the cities to start working in factories their kids needed to be cared for while they worked and then their kids were likely to have factory jobs and so the purpose of the public education system this is why there's rows of desks and Factory bells and this insistence on timing was to produce disciplined obedient workers certainly not to produce people who were autonomous and um that was adopted in the U.S the Japanese adopted it and militarized like mad and part of the consequence of that was the outbreak of the second world war and but but that being chained to a desk that's not a bug that was a feature right right and you know you can also even say well let's give it some credence a rural uh worker their their time schedules must like stringent than someone who's going to work on a factory right they're on an agrarian Farm they're on a farm yeah you're much looser in your time sense and it is the case that industrialization requires clock yes and so you have to give the devil is due but in a somewhat post-industrial World which is what we're in now it's not obvious at all that obedient worker slash Soldier is the right model for human development right and so okay so back to yourself so so really not knowing any of that which I would find out later we just wanted something different for our children so we started out with a blank sheet of paper this is all about the time Khan Academy and some great new things on the internet are bubbling with the Socratic method and said what would we design for our children and this is you and your wife yeah and my wife gets to be careful just like Tammy's special Laura is the one that did all this and I kind of come into the picture later but she's I mean I'm I'm helping from behind the scenes but she's she's really the person who's building this we start out with seven children um where did you get the other kids uh by talking to everybody in town and seeing who would be crazy enough to join us now by that point the acting MBA named after Lord Acton power tends to corrupt absolute power corrupts absolutely the acting NBA is pretty well known in town so the fact we start this thing called Acton Academy it has a little bit of linkage in Austin to be something people might trust us with their children right right right so you've got a bit of you got a bit of communication classes yeah so there was enough reputational you know that we we were able to attract some very committed families uh the school takes off uh it starts to grow um it's all based on one Mission we stayed true to from the start that every child who enters our school is a genius who deserves to find a calling that will change the world just like physical exercise daily spiritual exercise is critical to your well-being especially in a world where

town right you're going to make more money and be happier than the average ivy league graduate plus your your customers won't be knee deep in sewage which is also well that's a good major plus that's a very plus yeah you know when I was at Harvard lecturing there one of my students who you know Daniel Higgins oh yes um we were working on formulation of theories of General cognitive ability and and then personality predictors of success at the same time Howard Gardner was working at the faculties of educate faculty of Education there and he produced this theory of multiple intelligence and it's a Preposterous theory on psychometric and scientific grounds partly because Gardner famously noted that he didn't really care about measurement and yeah that's a no-go if you're right it's like well there are multiple intelligences but we can't measure any of them right right but but you know having said that again you have to give the devil is due is that cognitive ability does seem to have a unidimensional structure there's sort of there's one dimension of being smarter not being smart and the smarter you are the faster you can learn a complex jaw and so for complex jobs that's very useful but the idea that there are multiple talents that's a fine idea you know and you see that reflected more in temperament is that open people are creative and agreeable people like to take care of people and uh disagreeable people are competitive and and tough and conscientious people are hard-working and dutiful and extroverted people like socializing and so the idea that each person is composed of a composite of traits and that that composite is unique and that's that out of that unique composite something unique and valuable can emerge that seems extraordinarily probable well and I'd say the biggest finding we've had has been that children are capable of far more than you've ever imagined children will play down to an institutionalized system but if freed along with structure and responsibility and systems they will build are capable of incredible things you know in the in the Michaela school which takes a very different approach to you in the UK um it's an inner city school and there's a wide range of General cognitive ability as a consequence so you can imagine in a typical class of 30 kids there would be kids with an IQ of 90 on the low end likely up to maybe 85 on the low end and then maybe up to 130 on the high end right so a real distribution but they're teaching at a very high rate and 75 percent of their graduates get accepted to Russell group universities in the UK and Russell group includes what the big UK universities so they've managed to set up a system where regardless of that immense variability in innate intelligence let's say there's there's tremendous emphasis on on rapid learning well so here's where here's where we might differ a bit or at least what we've discovered and what we've discovered is you know a IQ no question is the most important determiner of success or you know socioeconomic success but it's still only what 25 right that seems about 25 so what we found is regardless of IQ if we can build a tribe where every person there believes that they have a calling to change the world that there is a place in that tribe now if my IQ is 100 I'm not going to be doing three body orbital problems right right I mean I just can't Advanced physics I can't do that right so that's okay there's other things I can do yeah so what we've found is there's very little uh variability in the ability to learn to do things if you provide people with a compelling story and reason yeah if you provide them with a recipe which is now you can find a recipe for anything on the internet and if you provide them with some sort of rubric so they can among themselves judge it and you provide them with some gamification some way to keep score that's fun it builds a tribe yeah and if you can do that and we do this in in groups of 36 the tribe is so complex and interesting it's all about the tribe once the tribe works we get learning happening at a two to three times average rate and most importantly the academic subjects become unimportant they all happen I mean it happens at a rapid rate but you're learning self-management self-governance and how to get along with people and build a culture and you can have all the artificial intelligence you want it can't do those three things okay so how so okay so now let's go back to when you started building this school and walk through it step by step because I really like to understand more deeply how these schools operate sure you know in the Michaela school that I referred to it's uh it's very structured yes and the teachers do the guiding and it's clear that the teachers are the ones in control and yes I was very impressed when I went there and her results are also very impressive the children are very secure and they're very pleased to be there we have about six of them take us around and they were just randomly selected from the from the school population and I asked them a lot of questions and so they're liking this um you're taking an approach that also requires the children to participate in their own self-organization yes so you could imagine that you could have a system where the basic rules of engagement are established by the authorities but the game is actually playable or you could have a system where the game if it's looser which would be the system that you set up where the demand for self-governance is placed in there to a large degree right at the beginning and and so this is very similar to a topvillian society that develops from the bottom up um we are providing though they don't have to invent democracy or Democratic Republic or a tyrannical government we'll provide them with choices so you don't have to prevent everything from a blank sheet but by experimenting it's a very Hayek in from the bottom up series of experiments and they learn by doing and I'll tell you that you know the environment is um it's tyranny one week and Lord of the Flies the next and they learn to find a medium between freedom and responsibility and they're continually working on the society okay so what would the experience like so how young what's the youngest children that you have in the in the program uh the youngest will be preschool so so five four five six okay so what do they experience their first day of school okay so at that age group it differs a little bit so there's 36 in the room it's mostly montessori-like learning to do real work so the routines of real work and free play and it's only and so you're beginning to learn to read and write and I'll get back to that in a minute Elementary studio is more about important work so you're doing real chores you're doing real work you're helping to start running the studio and you're playing hard games and that hard game may be learning math but it's a hard game I mean right so these are games now by Middle School you know you're tackling real world things your beginning apprenticeships as early as age 11 or 12.

and so you're actually beginning to take those talents out in the real world so it changes from Studio to studio right right so it starts to broaden right so what happens with children's games is that as the children mature the games become more and more like real world occupations that's what we're doing and then you know you could also say interestingly enough on the adult side the more you can turn your real world occupation into a genuine child's game the better you are at it so it's weird how those things meet well and that's that's part of playing this is the realization if you're always saying we believe you're a hero is going to change the world here's a story about Martin Luther King here's the story of that so when I said there's a why to doing this you're you're continually being given archetypal hero real world stories of flawed Heroes right yeah perfect Heroes and you're having to work this out at the same time you're working out whether I'm going to hit you in the head at age at five and if I do their consequences but those consequences are lie are largely meted out by eight-year-olds who are forming their society and learning to form their society and I will tell you in our high schoolers and our middle schoolers um 80 of them are better than anybody that graduated from my Harvard Business School class and culture because all they're at what at culture it forming a healthy culture right so is that better at negotiating it's negotiating it's carrying um I'll give you a quick example of how you move up so no grades the the standards are held by the community very high standards but here's how they work you keep track of the work you've done and you earn points that's effort yeah so how much effort are you putting in yeah every six weeks there's a public exhibition The public's invited it's not a science fair it's going to be an exhibition of learning for example if we're doing the medical biology Quest these young people will be diagnosing diseases of people coming in who have a stack of cards that are their disease and the winner of the game most accurately diagnoses real diseases for real with real cost so what do they learn they learn to manage their own health care which in the United States the public reward progress but you actually have standards of attainment at the same time yes see what there's an overlap between what you're doing in the Michaela school because they're also extremely good at rewarding both progress and actual levels of attainment and so the attainment here is did most of your patients live right at a low cost and through that you're going to learn to actually listen and diagnose diseases even for yourself so badges or attainment yeah public exhibition points or effort last piece which is important is 360 peer reviews every person's asked is Dr Peterson warm-hearted one to ten yeah or is Dr Peterson tough-minded enough one to ten yeah and then I give you feedback and it can't be you're stupid it can be you know when you interrupt me when I'm working hard that's really frustrating would you please when I have the red flag up not interrupt me when I'm working hard right so so I'm requesting so I'm learning how to be a good friend a good citizen okay so now you've got anything okay so those are the three things happening so you've got reward for progress you've got an absolute standard of attainment and then you've also got something like um evaluation of the manner in which you conduct yourself within the within the culture within the group okay so in the 360 process just for those of you who are watching and listening is that it's not that easy to figure out how to evaluate people inside a corporation so for example if you're trying to evaluate middle managers you can't get a direct measure of their sales Effectiveness because they're three steps removed from any sales process and so the question is how do you know if they're succeeding and how do they know that's a big question because you can't even get rewarded unless you know what the criteria are for success and failure and so one of the ways that corporations have learned to deal with this that's actually quite effective is by doing these processes they call 360s and in a 360 your subordinates rate you and give you feedback your peers do and your superiors do yes and so then that's aggregated and you can set that up so that it's not so it's as as unbiased with relationship to the hypothetically desirable outcomes as you can manage but it's an effective way compiling multiple reports like that is an effective way of of gaining uh valid say diagnostic information and a great way to learn to give and receive valid criticism right right that it's helpful criticism this is positive criticism right so yes and criticism we should also point out that's not here's what you're doing wrong that's here's what you're doing really right because yes the core of criticism is what you're doing right but here are things you're doing that as far as we can tell are interfering with what you're doing right and the separating of the wheat from the chat and that's why almost all of us offered at the school's growth mindset praise we appreciate your the method of what you're doing now again adults can't do this adults can never make a declarative sentence on campus adults can only ask you questions and they're very few adults because the young people run everything so let me fast forward a bit to the story and then we'll come back um we're running these it's a lot of fun um a researcher comes down from my old Professor Clayton Christensen at Harvard and said we're going to pick you as one of the top elementary schools in the United States we've only been around 18 months that's that's really silly they call back and the researcher says we're actually going to name you the top elementary school in the United States or the ones we've studied and this is the Christensen Institute so it's a big deal at Harvard um we're kind of shocked the researcher and her husband who's CFO of Hawaiian Airlines fly from Hawaii to Texas for their first visit they said can we come visit we said yes we get an email from them at the DFW Airport while they're changing planes going back to Honolulu we decided we're moving our family and five children to Austin so they can attend the school wow and so we said wow maybe we have something about this same time a dear friend and former student is very successful in Guatemala ask if he can start a school so we hand him a big stack of mimeograph stuff yeah yeah and six months later we're learning more from him than he is from us right right so you're starting to franchise it yeah well actually it was just like hear a friend a parent moves out to California and she tells her husband I'm not leaving if I can't take the school with me so we hand her a stack we're learning more I said okay let's start 10 of these and we can learn from each other we'll be right back first we wanted to give you a sneak peek at Jordan's new series Exodus so the Hebrews created history as we know it you don't get away with anything and so you might think you can bend the fabric of reality and that you can treat people instrumentally and that you can bow to the Tyrant and violate your conscience without cost you will pay the piper it's going to call you out of that slavery into Freedom even if that pulls you into the desert and we're going to see that there's something else going on here that is far more Cosmic and deeper than what you can imagine the highest Spirit to which we're beholden is presented precisely as that spirit that allies itself with the cause of Freedom against tyranny I want villains to get punished but do you want the villains to learn before they have to pay the ultimate price that's such a Christian question yeah are you still operating fundamentally at the preschool and early school well we're now beginning to to have a middle school and that's why I step in and I end up I end up running the middle school and the high school with 45 students I do that because we've hired this uh traditional teacher who's won a lot of awards and the week before we're going to start he turns to me and says you know when these middle schoolers get out of line you just Jack them up against the lockers and tell them who's boss and I went back and told Laura I said you're going to fire this guy so you might as well do it now and she said well middle school is going to start in a week what am I going to tell the parents and I said well I'll step in for a little bit and I'll help and that was my introduction and then for 13 years I I did that but suddenly we you know we have two we have three of these schools now we're going to have 10 and it just takes off and fast forward to today we have 18 000 people who have started an audition who want to start a school we have 300 schools in 26 countries and 43 or 44 U.S states and so we built a model with all these wonderful entrepreneurial parents and most of the people that run the schools are people like you and me that want to do it for their children and it's a loose Consortium it's almost like building Legos or eunuchs or you know it's it's a network that's continually changing a model yeah that's improving it and so now we've got 300 people contributing to the Improvement of the model which changes really weakly gets better almost all of it though handing more freedom and responsibility to the children yeah decentralized model though too and we can get back to what that means on the cost front so yeah okay so now kid goes kids five goes to one of your classes you said that there's there's some formal learning taking place so with regard to reading well but there's a lot of play well so there's a lot of play uh they're learning math on Khan Academy once they can learn to read I mean so they're they're learning to read and you know really children when they want to learn to read unless they're dyslexic we'll learn to read and I'll get to how we do that if they're dyslexic they need a little extra training yeah but if you just some children learn to read it four and some learn delivery to seven I mean it's just there's there's a span of when they're ready you see the same on the speaking yes you know and there's actually you might think that the smart kids learn to speak earlier and there's actually no evidence for that so yeah yeah kids can vary substantially in the the date at which they pick up language that the date at which they formulate full sentences I wish you would talk to some of our parents who are panicked that their child isn't you know it's like if you'll just be patient the child will come yeah there's almost no children that don't develop language it's it's such a universal human so they're around all these peers who are helping them and it's multi-age so remember you got older and younger and they're mixing around and you can't really tell who's the smartest or because everyone's good at something but the way we handle reading and I've gotten criticism is you can start with comic books or a magazine yeah and so well let's make them read the classics and I said if you make them read the classics they will hate the classics but what happens is but you can't have them read something that's too difficult for them right off you have to then there's no reason not to use incremental move forward let's read The Iliad at six it's like okay but once they start reading comic books and magazines then all of a sudden you see them pick up Harry Potter yeah and then by 11 or 12 summer reading Democracy in America War and Peace now if you read that or 11 and 12 you need to read it at 21 31 41 right I mean but they love to read as a group and so reading becomes something that's just what's your failure rate on the literacy front excluding the dyslexic kids well we could talk about zero zero zero zero uh-huh it's zero and so what what are your what's your criteria for for evaluating literacy say by the age of 10.

or hear about so um so so you you read something uh you get a badge for something called a deep book you have to pitch the book as being you know important rated by experts when there's a whole criteria right so you teach them how to select good books your classmates have to agree that it's a deep book and then if it is it goes on a list so you can choose from the list or you can pitch one that you like yeah but these are all real books I mean they're really they're books that would anybody and so you have to read that book you have to tell why it impacted you and whether you would recommend it to someone else and that becomes a badge that's probably like a six page thing that you create to try to pitch the book to someone else right right and so how to make a case how do we know that they're good is you look at the badges now here's the thing who approves that badge right no adults in the room uh-huh well the answer is um the standards of excellence are if you've never done this before did you put your heart into it yeah okay so that's effort if you've done it once is this time better than last time right great if you've done it enough times that it's hard to see the incremental gain because you've kind of plateaued let's compare it critique it to a Master how is your story short story compared to Hemingway right right right and if you win some sort of contest in the studio or an external contest it's excellent so Dr Peterson signs off on my badge is excellent now you're going to imagine with human nature there's a little log rolling that's going to go on right we're buddies I'm going to prove yours you're going to print mine but if you're real buddies you're you're not going to game the system so that the results are no longer yeah but there are enough Free Riders and so that starts to happen yeah but there's an audit committee so the audit committee will put out a survey that's Anonymous every six weeks and say whose badges should be audited and you take those three because who knows whose badges should be audited right the people in the room know and you don't embarrass those people how do you stop that from turning into a like an Informer festival and getting Free Riders on that front well I'll get back to kind of when you have toxic I mean toxic sub drives and things so yeah I can't but but generally the group is One Tribe by this time and so you don't really have that that's not really tolerated by the group okay but so what will happen is you know who who volunteers for the audit committee yeah well they're tough people right I mean they're easy people don't want to do the work so now you've got the toughest judges they'll take the three people that the studio said should be audited and at random choose three more now no one knows whether you were chosen at random or you were on the list kind of everybody probably knows but then we're going to do a deep audit of those of those badges if Jordan Peterson approved Jeff sandifer's badge and it's rejected then you lose a badge of the same value so you just lost six weeks of work and now all of your badges are going to be audited so we've had Learners real strict real strict uh what would you call it that's that's some that's free writer control essentially so for for those of you watching and listening so the the population prevalence of dark tetrad traits at a clinical level is about four percent and so the dark tetrat is Machiavellian narcissistic Psychopathic and sadistic and that cross-culturally that seems to be about one person in 25 who's enough like that to be a serious problem and they're basically in the extreme there's something like parasitic predators and they'll game well-functioning systems to attract credit to themselves with no work and so you always see people think that societies can just be set up on a Cooperative basis and that you can just assume the best about everyone and that'll work but it and it does work 96 of the time but it really doesn't work four percent of the time and that 4 percent is toxic enough to bring the whole damn system crashing down so you need to return Tit for Tat essentially there has to be control mechanisms set up in a well-functioning micro Society so that the Free Rider narcissist types can't get a toe hold and that takes a certain amount of tough-mindedness yes right often that's the often the sort of thing that's lacking among utopian-minded utopia-minded educational reformers because they have a while we don't need competition in our schools for example it's all cooperation it's like yeah that's fine until the free writers come along and then it's not fine at all you need Justice and mercy right because they're both yeah and so and so if you think about it warm-hearted tough-minded the 360s that's what we're measuring and encouraging and giving people but you need this system of auditing well that's interesting that that you use both warm-hearted and tough-minded eh because that's reflection of a trait on the agreeable Dimension and agreeable people are compassionate and polite they're maternal that that's really the right way of thinking about it the kind of maternal that would be properly devoted to a very dependent infant and so there's something lovely about that right as lovely as maternal love but on the other end which is the more masculine and there's more let's keep the Free Riders at Bay and then let's also only reward actual attainment right and there's love in that too but it's more like it's the love of of discipline and encouragement well and those of us that are tough-minded I'm tough-minded disagreeable need to learn when to be warm-hearted yeah the ones that are too warm-hearted need to learn for their own good when to draw boundaries and so that's what develops and all this now by the way we do see for us it's about one out of a hundred we see someone we see highly toxic children come in I can't explain why I'm just telling you their behavior I'm not saying they're damned or they're doomed yeah yeah because you can always actually be asked to leave the community and come back you can repent yeah but you see every once in a while now there's also often a strong correlation to the family or not listen but sometimes not you know but that's the only time an adult will step in if they see that happening and what markers do you have for that they're telling very small lies just like the Dragon book right you just can catch them because otherwise the system will correct but the system can't take someone who's smart enough to parse this you know you're always staying right inside the lines right and so over time the tribe will learn even the young ones to recognize that but when you're fresh and new yeah and so what what an owner that's why Psychopaths like in the real world psychopaths are itinerant because they can't stay longer well they can't stay because people figure out their games and and then they stop them and I you know one of the problems with the virtual world right now is that it allows the Psychopaths to be continually itinerant which is essentially what you are if you're anonymous right is that nobody can get a handle on you you can't track the reputation and you know the people who promote the benefits of online anonymity say well what about the heroic whistleblowers and it's like fair enough but they're one percent right yeah the heroic whistleblowers but what about the enabled Psychopaths well the whistleblowing is worth the psychopathy it's like yeah it doesn't look like it's interesting because the group gets pretty good even in early Asia recognizing it but the first time they see it it's like when you've said before about a dark Triad or a dark quadrant um male can take advantage of a young female yeah the females will learn yeah yeah well eight-year-olds learn too yeah yeah but but we will we will step in and say Here's a transition contract if these things don't happen you're going to need to leave and reapply so we will pick out but it's one out of a hundred yeah we'll see someone who's and so so we're probably drawing you know from some segment that's slightly healthier because they won't apply maybe but about one with kids so there's pretty good literature on this if you group two-year-olds together and watch them interact about four percent of the males it's almost none of the females yeah about four percent of the males at age two will kick hit bite and steal okay so that's not very many that's three percent of the populations one in fifty so it's not much different from but but most of those kids despite their temperamental proclivity to be aggressive are socialized by the age of four almost all of them someone has to socialize yeah maybe help them either control that aggression or integrate it better to integrate it the the kids who don't have that integrated by the age of four they're in for a pretty dismal ride yeah there isn't a lot of clinical evidence suggesting that if those traits are still in place at the age of four that they can be ameliorated at that point yeah and so and those are the kids that turn into bullies and delinquents and we see something very similar that and I wanted to ask you because we see something else and I'm curious what the literature says about this it appears to us that that the tribe in these systems and this took villain in society will shape conscientiousness until about 13.

yeah and and so so there are some people that are naturally conscientious yeah and there are others it seems to shape our experience is when we take someone after the age of 13 if the culture is spun up they will behave in a conscientious way but without the culture they will regress back to where they are well part of what happens at 13 okay so imagine you have these aggressive kids yeah okay at four now they maintain a high level of aggressive behavior okay now at about 14 the boys join them under the influence of testosterone and so and then for for the for the normal boys who have this spike in aggression that decline start to decline pretty rapidly around 18 and then and then goes back down to where you'd expect it if you just tracked it linearly um whereas the criminal types don't desist what happens with the criminal types generally speaking is that they start to desist in their late 20s and so the the fundamental hard-headed penological theory for repeat offenders you know one percent of the criminals right costs so for re for True repeat offenders is you just keep them in jail till they're 30.

right and then it might be delayed maturation something like that you know but after that they're not as big a threat yeah yeah they they start being so so incentivized by the way the thing we see over and over and over again and I can't stress this enough and I think it's my theory of why the United States works is the 80 20 rule is one of the most powerful rules of prayer and so what you see is if you believe every child's a genius yeah you find the child that's good at all these each of these different things but they all have a place yeah just like I can be a plumber or an airline pilot but you see that in these societies as they grow you got to find your place in the so the Pareto this 80 20 rule this is um 20 of your customers produce 80 of your sales 20 of the recording artists sell 80 of the records 20 of the authors sell 80 of the books the actual rule is the square root of the number of people doing a particular task perform half the labor and so this drives inequality in every creative domain but your point is there's a diverse enough range of potential Pareto contributions it doesn't matter right like you can be an off the chart plumber and I can be an off the chart mathematician and there's zero trouble if we're only going to measure how quickly I can memorize things for a test I'll never use again and it's basically IQ then there's only going to be one winner of that or one group of winners yeah in this case there's all sorts of ways you can win and it's so complicated you can't even keep track yeah but what you can keep track of are these stories that are repeated over and over and over again about heroes don't win when they get knocked down they get back up yeah and it becomes kind of a resilience a resilience a hey it's a challenge yeah we talk about I may have gotten this from you like what are the three monsters The Three Monsters Are resistance distraction and victimhood it's like if I can't which one of those is standing in my way right resistance I just need to take the first step right yeah and that might just be apprehension of sheer complexity right but what do you do take a step okay distraction and if you can't then take a smaller step exactly I mean take one more step towards the elevator yeah um and so distraction it's what's valuable to you in Focus I mean yeah prioritizing Focus right right if it's victimhood then gratitude is the only substitute for is the only Elixir and so they learned that yes and we should we should also point out in that regard that that gratitude isn't the naive insistence that the world is a perfectly delightful place and that everything is going to go well gratitude is a practice it's a moral virtue and the the The Virtuous part of it is the courage to find and even the darkest Place some light that can guide you through right and the willingness to do that the understanding that that's a practice I mean when my wife my wife was extraordinarily ill a few years ago like fatally ill so the story went and one of the things she did that was of Aid to her physically because it helped her be less stressed and that's good on the immunological front but Also spiritually let's say was to strive very diligently to look for what she could be grateful for in each day and even in each moment and in her situation I think this is very often the case for people who are facing very serious illness she was grateful for the love and support of her family and her friends and and and that was also genuine and also of genuine aid but it is a it's a courageous practice it's not a kind of naivety and so if you're surrounded by a group that understands if you're playing the part of the victim they don't say don't be a victim they begin to ask you questions about gratitude and give you space right sometimes you want to play the victim for a while yeah well sometimes terrible things are happening right right sometimes yeah your life's just and so then you get someone who's actually you know I'm very empathetic that that's happening I'm sympathetic to you that that's happening but then the answer is once you're finished with that yeah what are we going to get up and go do right that's good for you right and we're going to have this moment so just imagine all these young people and by the way the high schoolers are going up and down to the Middle School in elementary all the time the middle schoolers are going up and down you'll see Elementary so this is a family this is like a neighborhood of young people moving around between Studios helping each other often you'll get a 10 year old that's better at calculus you know than a high schooler right and they're up and it has to always for the 10 year old he gets to share his knowledge with with older kids that's what we have 10 year olds that actually sell tutoring services so they have to be Socratic they can't lecture yeah but but anyway but that's the beauty is they're learning how to build a society they're learning self-management yeah they're learning self-governance they're learning how to treat other human beings yeah and guess what the learning's exploding oh and by the way they've had six or seven apprenticeships in the world by the time they're in high school yeah and how do you set those up and what do what do the apprenticeships look like it's the easiest and best thing we do you go through a series of challenges of what you might want to do with your life even 11 or 12.

like what's exciting I want to be a vet yeah I want to be so then you learn how to go find out the owner of the vet service what have they done in their life that's valuable then you write an email that says Mr Smith I've so admired your compassion with animals I know that you won this award it has to be genuine right right would you show you've done your homework but then the question is I I'm looking for this apprenticeship I'm not asking you for it I'm just asking can I have a five minute phone call to explain it right it's all I want yeah so you get the phone call you listen for objections and try to answer them right yeah and only ask then is can I have two minutes in person you show up in person and you imagine this 12 year old is showed up ready and they say Dr Peterson would you give me a chance yeah I'll show up early yeah work late yeah I'll wash the floors I'll do whatever you ask yeah yeah if I don't ever do one of those things not only can you fire me immediately but it's going to reflect on all my studio mates they're going to find out but if you'll give me a chance I'll prove myself yeah it's an irresistible success rate on that is like 98 now so what no that's interesting in and of itself you know because we're we're constantly bombarded with this insistence especially from the radical left that the reason that you might employ someone is to skim off their excess labor right the Marxist theory of of Labor and that you're it's basically an exploitative relationship and you can be cynical about this he said well no kidding the businessmen are going to agree because now they've got free labor but that isn't what happens like what happens is that and you have to be unbelievably cynically cynical and blind and believe that the world is motivated by power to believe anything other than this is that the the ability to act as parent uh proxy is there in all of us to the degree we can be parents and it's extraordinarily attractive to offer people the opportunity to establish a relationship with someone who's Young where they're fostering their development I think that's a primary source of human gratification I actually think there's also something that's I wouldn't call it cynical but it's a little more self-interested that the people who are being like very generous because this is you know it's hard to have an apprentice yeah yeah but I actually we've seen this happen at the Acton MBA I I think it's they're looking up to you as The Wizard of Oz and you're seeing in them a young new right and there's this sense of that reminds me myself yeah and you know and that's the best part of myself the best part of myself and in fact if I had had this at that age right and so I'm so attracted to this but but anyway through this process what do you learn how to do you learn how to find something to do that matters in your life serving someone else and by the time you also learn how to ask someone you learn how to suggest in an attractive manner to someone how they might offer you an opportunity this is one of the reasons it's so useful to teach your child uh to help your child develop extremely polished manners yeah and because what happens if you have well-mannered kids who say please and thank you and who know how to shake hands and introduce themselves and who are sensible enough to listen to an adult then they will charm the adults and not an instrumental way a manipulative way but they'll charm the adults and the adults will reveal the best part of them and then they'll offer the kids all sorts of opportunities and so what a deal that is for your kids and we see they just happen over and over and what do we have to do nothing we don't set these up we don't match right right the young people go out and do it all with parental permission and with you know the parents have to sign off it's safe but they're out there doing you know our boys um went through amazing they ended up their their final apprenticeships were SpaceX right and you know what we they did that on their own I mean well that's great too because that makes it their accomplishment oh that's another thing that's so useful about not doing too much for other people isn't it so one of the things that as a therapist it's very easy to steal your clients success and to Slough off their risk so for example if you come to me and say well do you have some advice on the career front and I say well this is what I think you should do and this is how I think you should do it and you go out and you do it it's like it's not obvious at all whose victory that is right right and then if you go out and fail well I failed as a therapist but not as much as you've felt so it's like your skin I'm gonna claim the victories and and stuff off the failures yeah well this is why by the way we don't ever talk about the success of our graduates because it's their success you just want to hear us talk about that I mean we just don't it's their success not ours to claim and it also brings up the hardest thing we have it's not the young people it's the parents and you know I I asked our son the other day a good friend was working on something about fatherhood and I asked our youngest son Sam um you know this whole fatherhood thing you would understand it better than I have because you're the customer right you're the person so what advice would you give my friend about fatherhood and he said you know when you're younger you just want your parents around and to pay attention to you yeah you know not coddle you not but just to be there and he said but once you get into kind of Middle School you're really around your peers and your parents their job then is to be a good role model and he said and this is what chilled me he said so to be a good father all you can do is work on yourself yeah and that's why it's so hard yeah and I stopped and I'm like oh my gosh have I worked on myself and you know but it was just like this is from from a 19 year old it's like as a father I need to love my child and work on myself yeah and that's the way the child will be healthy the reason that when we have a problem is generally the parent you know over parenting or wanting to intervene for the child yeah and they're they're prohibited by contract from doing that they sign a contract says I won't do that and then they'll do it anyway right right and so it's very hard for parents to let go of it is hard that's their habit it is hard I mean and there is a narcissism in that too because then the parent gets to take credit for the child's success right and to trumpet that and yes and that's well that's that whole edible mother nightmare that Freud outlined so brilliantly so long ago it's like and it's it's hard if you're a caregiver you know again to give the devil is due yeah and I think it's probably harder for women because they have to give their all to their infants in a self-sacrificing manner yes because infants require full dedicated this isn't about me care the problem is so the psychoanalyst said the good mother necessarily fails and what they meant by that was the woman is faced with this terrible necessity of dispensing with that full-fledged maternal care incrementally and letting the child facilitating the child's movement forward and I think it's very useful for a woman to have her masculine side developed for that or to have more more likely to have a male partner around who's more oriented towards encouragement than than let's say that intense maternal care but but um it's definitely the case that you want to Foster in your children and in the people you're mentoring that ability to do things on their own there's a rule of thumb for care of elderly people it's a very good one um never do anything for the person you're caring for they can do themselves right and that's a that's that's because I want them to keep keep doing everything they can yeah you don't want well and you want them to retain their dignity and steal from that what is what they have left and you want to encourage their autonomy if for no other reason then then you're not going to be overburdened with having to do everything right right so and that well okay so let's uh two questions here one is how do you develop that Community ethos that orients the entire Community to regulate the the behavior of the members in a positive manner how do you how do you how do you how do you bring that about you're continuing to play game after game after game with different kinds of motivational systems so sometimes it's the hero's journey and more of a you know Maslow's hierarchy kind of feeling or a onion feeling sometimes it's uh being rewarded with extrinsic rewards sometimes those are Squad based sometimes they're individual sometimes the whole studio sometimes they're awesome you're just playing game after game after game so it's an aggregation of playable games it's a lot of experiments going on within a rubric that you know is rewarding this feedback um and collapses and then part of it is it's hard because the studio will completely collapse and as an adult you want to step in and fix it right and so we say Okay step back yeah take a deep breath leave it alone okay collapse in what way um there's two clicks and they're arguing about something and the civility's broken down and you know social fragmentation or or Excellence you know the people have kind of gotten uh blase about Excellence or I saw something interesting in our high school and our launch pad um they had built such a complex cool society that the and you know this from having your own companies you know if you're not careful you build up so many rules that your company becomes a bureaucracy yeah so they were getting to that stagehold it was a beautiful society and they looked at it and they said we're going to do away with all but three rules and if we want to put a rule back the first thing we're going to do is ask the person the rules being instituted for why do you not want to be here because you know right so we're not going to put a rule for the edge case we're going to deal with the individual and try to listen to them and maybe they need to leave for a while or maybe we need to help them or and so you just see these complex set and simple and complex set of experiments and they're learning by doing and watching and so when you either get you know a tyrannical situation or Lord of the Flies going on you step back once and then it always gets worse you step back again yeah and here's the magic that happens at that point three or four of The Sheepdogs what we call them because they're the ones that get the wolves we'll come to you and say we don't want to live like this anymore and then you say socratically well do you think you would like to try a pure democracy or a Democratic Republic they might not even know at age eight what that is yeah but they have the internet then go figure it out yeah yeah and they'll come back and have a town council meeting and vote on a new structure we had one time we were we were actually right so so you so now they have a problem with governance and now they have the motivation to find out what good governance means so so we got actually ejected as a guide I got ejected from the studio because I they didn't want me in there anymore so for a week there'll be a week go by and no adult goes in our Middle School it runs itself so I was actually kind of asked to leave so I left I thought well we'll see what they do with it yeah the studio broke down I didn't really know what was going on inside um I came back after about 10 days I was invited back because they couldn't create as good a learning challenges the games they were creating weirdest Goods they wanted some more games when I came back in they had taken masking tape and they had divided the studio into like eight city-states because they've been reading about city-states each city-state had a different governance system and people were voting with their feet where to where to reside oh yeah that kept going for about six months it turned out to be an incredibly powerful way to organize the studio and then at some point that the competition between it's a competition between the invitations you know I've been thinking about this on the religious front talking to as I probably have talked about this most particularly with some of the more fundamentalist Muslims that I've talked to that the the notion of holy war Jihad William James said 150 years ago that we needed a moral equivalent to war right something as difficult and challenging but oriented towards the uppermost good let's say and I was thinking about the religious competition as a competition between invitations and so the idea would be and this is sort of like the idea that as an adult you're a role model for your teenagers like all right so you've got this set of principles on the Islamic side let's say are you such a shining example of those principles in practice that people look at you and think man I'd like to abide by that by that code and that seems right to me is that a competition of invitations first of all it has the advantage of competition it's like well there's a bunch and that's and that's experimentation essentially right and it can be intense competition but if it's Invitational then people get to use freedom of conscience and free of Association to choose and that seems to give us the best of both Best of Both Worlds so how did you manage to motivate yourself to stay the hell out of it when when things were well it's where I was lucky that having you know been in Harvard Business School and been among the best Socratic teachers in the world having practiced Socratic teaching and we had all these Hotshot entrepreneurs that came to teach with us at the MBA level but you had to help and work with them and yourself to keep your ego out of it so you know if you're teaching a case and you're I mean all of our teachers were very exceptionally successful entrepreneurs you want to step in and give the answer right yeah but that was faster but but that was forbidden I mean like you would get ejected from the teaching Corps for doing that and so we all agreed to live by a contract and we had micro routines we would execute just like in the studio there's all these micro routines layered upon each other yeah and so I was just equipped I mean I want to give an answer as much as anybody else in the world and I do sometimes I shouldn't yeah but I'm equipped to say it's so much more powerful to say yeah would you do a or b next well you know for for the men that are listening this is a useful thing to know about your wives I mean it's true in interpersonal Communication in general but you know your wife is going to sit down with you and lay out her complaints about whatever happens to be happening and you might think that you know what to do about that and you might think that what she wants is for you to do something about it and to provide an answer now that also might be your impatience because you want to just get to the cut to the Chase and solve the damn problem and so it's not all moral virtue on your side that you actually know what to do but what you have to understand is that when someone's first walking through a problem set part of what they're trying to do is to figure out what the problem is and so unless you let them lay out the problem landscape without interference you you don't even know that the problem you're solving is the correct problem and so and that you you definitely see this in the psychotherapeutic relationship all the time is that man once you've got the problem properly identified you're 90 of the way to solving it but that wandering around to begin with yeah and the Socratic method is very useful for that it also helps people build well to investigate their doubts thoroughly but also to build the analytic skills necessary to to assess a problem properly and to start to strategize I remember Laura was in um a discussion with one of our top acting MBA teachers one time we were in a case discussion and he's a wonderful guy named Stephen Thompson he stopped her in mid-sentence and he said ask yourself at this moment would you rather be right or would you ever rather be curious right right and it changed a lot I mean she's also she's always been a curious person she was like oh I was trying to be right at this moment yeah and so it's those kind of Revelations yeah that's like well that's true that's that's the that's the pharaonic temptation as in Pharaoh is to be right now a good way around that I think metacognitively is to think okay are there more things you know or more things that you don't know now anyone with any sense knows that no matter how thick the book they've read you know in total is the book of things they haven't read or encountered is way thicker yeah and so then the next question is well would you rather be friends with what you know or friends with what you don't know and that's an infinite landscape and so if you can learn to be the friend of what you don't know then and and you're really afraid about that it's like no no I I need to know here I might be wrong in my presumption of being right and then it it opens up I think that's part of what opens up the underlying motivation for True Socratic questioning if I'm if I'm talking to my wife I actually want to know you know even though part of me doesn't why she thinks what I'm doing isn't working because it's possible that if I could listen carefully enough I could find out something stupid that I'm doing and quit doing it and I would rather stop doing stupid things because life's hard enough without putting up unnecessary obstacles now imagine these kinds of discussions going on they happen for there's a 15-minute Socratic launch in the morning there's a 15-minute launch after launch there's a 15 minute close so you're having these young people are having on a detailed moral problem of real relevance to them these Socratic discussions over and over and over again every day and then so what would a discussion like like that look like what kind of topic might come up uh it might be we're having an issue uh with Clicks in the studio um and so there would be something about what is a click and how to clicks form right and the question might do it's implied well actually actually what we would ask you is uh we would say what's the biggest issue in the studio right now is it intentionality is it civility is it excellence um right right projectization and whichever one they picked it would be okay okay what should we do about this should we set smart goals should we run a 360 survey should we and then after a very short while they're leading these discussions right what should we do and why it's always relevant there's probably a hero story in fact you know the way we we do civilization I've talked with Larry arnott Hillsdale about this you'll be in a group of five ten-year-olds and you get a question to go research and the question might be was John F Kennedy the nerdy will son of a rich man or America's greatest president assassinated in his prime now 10 year olds have no idea who John F Kennedy is right right but he was assassinated he was a richer that's pretty cool yeah right so they'll go spend 30 minutes researching or an hour researching all about Kennedy yeah then they'll come back and they'll start debating that and before they're done it'll be like well what does make a great president yeah and what is your Prime and what is no adult these deep rich and by the way after that you never forget who John Kennedy was or the Cuban Missile Crisis but all it takes is one question and the right Rules of Engagement yeah and you can back away yeah well that's also how you can set up critical thinking as a as a really motivating game so in my in my fourth year seminar we would go through scientific papers one by one I I would pick the papers classic scientific papers and then I would extract out some of the core questions and then I divided this was fun I divided the groups my students there's about 20 into groups of four and I put the introverts in one group in the extroverts another and the reason was is that introverts will talk but they're threshold for speaking is higher and the lag time is longer so if you have an extroverted with a bunch of introverts yeah yeah because they're they're they they they're more likely to interrupt earlier so I'd put the introverts together so that was fun and I would assign aside of the question arbitrarily and the rule was look I don't really care what your opinion is about this issue not because I don't care about your opinion but because it's worthwhile to explore the entire problem set and it's very worthwhile to learn to think critically and to think critically after take opposing sides and so the students would have this discussion and then the rest of them would vote on the outcome and it was extraordinarily engaging and the students really liked it and they would spend in-class time doing the investigation right then and there right without you having to do anything right I mean yeah yeah well we did the same with the Revolutionary War you know you had the Tories you have the Patriots and then you had this group in between it was about a third or third and a third and then it's like the two sides the Tories and the Patriots have to argue and the people in the middle are going to vote with their feet and you're going to see who won so there's all sorts of just experiment after experiment after experiment right and so that oh yeah okay so that's that's what pageo my my friend I have a friend who's a very religious thinker and he he um he's developed model of governance that's very much like that that's extracted out of the Exodus story has to do with uh the distribution of response imagine there's tyranny and chaos and so that'd be tyranny and slavery let's say and then there's a model of good governance that is the alternative to both of those and it's something like distributed responsibility and something like this idea of nested games so in in the subsidiary organization an individual has responsibility for himself and then paired individuals have responsibility for their family and impaired families have responsibility for the community and then paired communities have responsibility for the state and there's there's games going on at every level that are well they should be games that are Guided by the spirit of the logos fundamentally but it should be distributed at every single level and that's the opposite of a totalitarian system so instead like in a totalitarian system every single person lies about everything all the time and in a well-governed system the opposite of the LIE isn't the truth it's more like it's more like something like uh The Humble approach to expanding knowledge it's an experiment or something it's a way of generating new knowledge well so think about the individual the squad the 36 person people in a cohort and then the whole campus yeah and then you have people that are also doing you know they're specializing in chemistry versus method and so you've got all these mixes like that going on all the time right and out of that comes a culture right and also because you have that diverse range of options so the the answer to the problem of inequality isn't equality the answer to the problem of inequality is a diverse enough game so that the that the distribution of inequality is normal right so like you said you can be a good plumber you can be a good abstract mathematician it doesn't matter they're both they're both they're both infinitely playable games and they're infinitely expandable well and the question that it keeps getting asked over and over again so one of the other things that you go do is they go do what are called stars and Stepping Stones interviews where you'll find people you admire who are between if those saying you're in high school your age and 25 25 and 40 and then you know over the age of 60s there's a there's a range and you'll go and what we found by doing thousands of those is at the age of 60 most people ask the same three questions they phrase them differently but it is did I contribute something meaningful was I a good person and who did I love and who loved me those three questions even at age eight are always on the table I see them again so did I contribute something meaningful right so meaningful specific meaningful was I a good person who did I love and who loved me right right now what I bring that up because we could pick I mean you and I could prioritize those differently and both win the game right right I mean so you're always asking and by the way those questions mean something different was I a good person means kind of black and white moral choice it 11 or maybe even 15.

it probably around your 20s 30s or 40s it's about am I becoming who I was meant to become I mean good has a different meaning right slightly different right right it's not so much abiding by the appropriate rules but but while we keep offering these moral choices that allow you to kind of self-rank in different ways it's not only aptitudes it's also what's important in life because you've got to ask what's success it's not how much money you make yeah making money is great but that's not the ultimate measure was it being how kind you are making money is great if it facilitates the other things that you just described right right it provides you with an expanded Horizon of opportunity it's not so great if it enables your hedonistic impulsivity in fact it could just kill you right I had lots of clients who were fine when they were broke yeah but the second one client in particular he used to get his unemployment check he was disabled at workplace injury and he was he was a pretty simple person and he was easily exploited by Psychopaths and those were his friends and what would happen to him is he'd get his unemployment check you know once a month and so he'd have lots of money for three days and it was off to the bar and and nose deep and cocaine and face down in a ditch and all his terrible parasitical friends would gather around him until his bones were plucked dry eventually that killed him wow yeah yeah and so money money is an enabler but it's also an enabler of Vice so so be careful right right be careful with money so yeah okay so let's maybe we should turn okay let's do something practical First if people are interested in these actin schools yes where can they find more information sure uh actin like a c t o n Academy dot org is that is where the schools are featured uh there's also something fascinating we do if you want to take a mini step it's called the children's business Fair where children will come and for one day pitch a business they'll have a business where they sell things oh yeah um we will have this year one thousand of those fairs across the United States and across the world and we'll serve about 50 000 young people and all you have to do if you want to start one of those that's kind of a stepping stone to an actin yeah is put out seven tables in your front yard and have your kids tell their friends and we have a whole system that we pay for everything we provide uh we provide prize money just as a it's just the thing our family wants to do and so and where can they people find information about children's business fair just Google that or children's businessfair.org there's a two-minute video it shows how you can start one in your backyard or actingacademy.org if people are interested in the school okay okay well we'll make sure we put those links in the description now we've we haven't talked at all about higher education maybe we should we should okay diverge into that momentarily um so we could talk about my uh Misadventures and reform uh under Governor Perry Texas governor Perry I think we'll I think I'll leave those for something more positive and just talk about what are we seeing from our super competent high schoolers who we call launch patterns because they're launching out in the world and what we're seeing increasingly is a belief that many colleges are about prestige and what they're about is competence yeah and so of course if you get a free ride to MIT and you're a gifted engineer you go to MIT yeah right I mean of course you would do that yeah um so would you pay 400 So Far So Far right right I know that could all change yeah um if you're you know from from uh well no matter who you are should you pay 400 000 from a no-name degree that won't get you a job from a place no one's ever heard of no that's a terrible idea so we're seeing that with all of these apprenticeships our launch patterns are coming out and they can get into whatever competitive College their scores are high enough to get into yeah but about four out of ten are going directly into industry and maybe hacking a degree somewhere on the side but they've realized so I think we're seeing our best and brightest begin to vote with their feet yeah and begin to think of college as a tool that may or may not be necessary I think that's more true of the boys no nothing it's pretty equally true now I will say um there is something to be said for college if you want to go to football games uh paint your face be in a tribe chase girls or guys yeah yeah right that's kind of what college has left yeah there's nothing bad about that we should also again give the devil is due I mean I've been trying to sort out why people will pay let's say two hundred thousand dollars for a four-year degree and here's a couple of reasons is you get away from your parents you have a transition point you establish a new group of peers and maybe you find a mate right especially the last one right if if that's your two hundred thousand dollar investment and you're you're you you have pooled around you eligible young people of a certain degree of let's say intellectual capability and discipline somewhat selected that's not such a bad deal that's not exactly the fundamental purpose of an educational institution but it's not trivial and it's not easy no and I think that's why it's I think this is why that's why the games continue to go yes so we're gonna have to find a way to replace that um or it's going to continue to be in essence a very expensive country club right yeah I mean it's a very expensive country club now it's a very big expensive country cult yes so and that's that and that's definitely a program and I and I think my you know my friends that are in higher ed and that are thoughtful have seen this coming the other the other issue that higher ed faces is as you well know they make all their money on the freshmen and sophomores teaching them with adjuncts yes right and so then you then the the upper division courses are very expensive taught by tenure faculty right but it's the internet that's threatening it's all the you know it's all the the distance learning is threatening the freshman and sophomore group but if they lose enough of that group or have to Discount then the whole model Turns Upside Down and higher ed has no way to cut costs yeah they can't because they can't cut costs Also let's talk about costs so yes we were talking last night you said in in Austin yeah it's 32 000 a year per student that's the public education cost right for K-12 but that that's also a that's an underestimate so yeah yeah so my my belief in what I've seen is that doesn't include all the facility cost properly accounted for right so so the number somewhere north of 32 000 uh last Saw and and you know that right that ranges from 20 000 around the country to much more than that um and you were gonna ask I think you were saying cost at action Academy um you know we've got some incredibly successful campuses that now are running looking at anywhere from a thousand dollars per student per year to maybe twenty five hundred dollars per student per year now we have some that have tuition as high as 35 000 a year so it varies yeah yeah but we're managing by the fact these young people are so super capable on their own we're managing to create Alternatives that um deliver an extraordinary both academic right so that's five percent of the cost fundamentally well and we should let's delve into those numbers a little bit I mean a pretty decent teacher's salary is sixty thousand dollars I don't think that's unfair right okay so that means if that means each two students could in principle hire a teacher just for them now maybe you could double that if you had to include the cost of a building because generally uh the infrastructure costs in the typical organization are about about equivalent to the Staffing costs if you need a rule of thumb and so that means that in principle what the education system is spending now would allow each group of four students to hire a full-time teacher yes right and so this is not an efficient system obviously well if you look at the head count um and this is true for all of your shoes by the way not just public education but it's about a five to one adult to learner um to student ratio now it's not it's not five to one per teacher but there's so many admin people five to one five students yeah there's five there's there's one adult for every five students right right that's that's the that's right across and and our rate is more like one adult for every 20 to 30 to 40 right to 50 students right and you're and that's so interesting too eh because one of the claims that's constantly put forward by teachers unions in particular is that well the only thing that really matters in education is teachers of student ratio right there should be more like there shouldn't be more than 10 students per teacher right and you can understand that to some degree if you believe that teacher attention to a given student is a marker for academic movement forward but your model is more the idea that no if the institution is well constituted then you produce maximal autonomy on the part of the participants and the and well they pick up the work they do the learning that goes along with picking up the work right well and the thing I say is fundamental is education is not the same as learning education is something you do to someone you educate them now you self-educate but if you're educating someone learning is what the person experience like the delivery of a product right and so knowledge I want to be careful here because our model is just one model there's going to be 50 fun models and interesting models come out for for learning uh as the world changes and you know my my great grandfather was president of the University he's buried on their campus I mean I came from a my wife's uh mother uh Joanna was one of the incredible teachers uh in Oklahoma City in fact the quick story that's worth telling about that we're having one of these exhibitions I talked about and this woman comes up to me and we're in Austin Texas and she comes up and she said you know this reminds me of my eighth grade science teacher and she said I live in Oklahoma City I came to see this and it reminds me of her and she started describing this wonderful teacher who was Socratic and who did all the things and she said um she got finished and I said and her name was Joanna Anderson oh and the lady said how in the world could you have known that and I said because that's her daughter Laura and the woman just started crying and she said that lady changed my life so adults have an important role to play in a child's life yeah that role shouldn't be to be an authoritarian you know having order to sit at the desk where a bell rings every 45 minutes yeah that's not the teacher's fault that's the system right it's the system now you're participating in the system yeah but I always try to you know I try to divide the teachers are often the heroes and sometimes not the system's the problem and I don't think there's anyone who doesn't think the system is broken they're going to be a lot of different recipes we've got a recipe that happens to be very low cost and seems to be powerful and it's a working also scalable and scalable we have one employee frequently and and our whole network our staff is one what one employee for 300 campuses because how do you facilitate communication between the campuses and exchange let's say best practices uh there's a forum where people are exchanging since we've been sitting here we've probably gotten four new experiments on the Forum when I get off I'll read them oh yeah so people are in so there's a way it's like Legos there's a way to share experiments yeah yeah and there's a way to report on them there's a central place it's almost like Unix code to store and we've been very careful how the modules fit together so they're defined so you can swap out modules and so people are running all right you have you have areas that you're we just touched upon this a little bit last night you have domains is that the right way of thinking about them like domains of of learning how do you structure the yeah so you would think about the typical Reading Writing math I mean there's ways to do that but what we have are these six-week quests and you might do for biology the medical Quest we talked about where you're diagnosing disease we have a great Quest on living will and dying will that's all that death and so those quests last for six weeks they're integrative and they'll teach you something about life personal finance biology but applied chemistry things you're going to really do and then you have genres which are much like your essay product except they're different recipes for writing a white paper a poem and so you're actually practicing something you're going to write and use in the real world and display in front of an audience uh it might be a speech so those chunks are well defined and you could create one I could create one we can present it to the crowd and the crowd votes them up right and then that's shared among the group and it becomes the standard until something replaces it right how do you stop or how how have you dealt with the problem of ideological capture let's say on whatever side of the political space well I I think we're we're agnostic I mean we have a series of promises like like we believe that um economic freedom religious freedom and political Freedom you know are are one of our core beliefs right so that's non-negotiable right so that's not negotiable so there's a series of things like that we believe every child is a genius who's you know who it's destined to change the world so there are a set of those you agree to and everything else is up for fair debate if you can make a and we've had right so you have a limited number of committed Communists you know in my group of high schoolers they would debate why Marx was right and it's fascinating to listen to him in fact there were times I was like that's a pretty dagged dumb good point I'm a committed capitalist who's like you know that's Market Fair that's an interest so everything's Up For Debate nothing is up for not saying something about the truth and it's all to be tested so there is no ideological capture from the left or right when you have to actually test things in the real world and debate them and can you be wrong of course you can and has has the the spread of let's say woke culture to to use a somewhat awkward phrase has that produced a challenge to the operation of your institutions or are people just sidestepping that problem altogether within the confines of your organization well so so if if if you came from um let's see let's say you came from one of the protected woke classes that people talk about if you want to be gay that's I mean that's I'm going to be tolerant of that that's not I mean I mean that's your choice right I'm not gonna now we could talk about the impacts that's going to have or what does that means but it's just an honest conversation and so right well those you know people who are different in their proclivity uh yeah like temperamentally or sexually let's say are still going to have to contend with the fact that they have to integrate that within a community difference is good now you stand up and say um I'm a victim yeah right and it's like well okay well let's why are you a victim let's explore that because victims aren't okay here so what are you going to do about it well I'm going to post on Instagram it's like what else might you do besides that I really care about this I'm going to post twice the problem with the victim narrative isn't so much the observation that unfair things happen to people and sometimes even systematically it's like for sure that's the case um the issue is do you remove from yourself all sense of agency and comrade Power by construing yourself as the tragic victim of like hyper powerful and irresistible forces the answer to that is yes all my agency is removed then the victim narrative is is actually what's victimizing right and so so if if you if you said life's unfair yeah the answer would be of course it is what are you going to do about it if you're not willing to do something about it personally then it must not be that big an issue well it's also the case that life is unfair in weird ways you know I mean one of the things that the Marxist types for example point to is the fact that well wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few and that tends to be the case and they tend to be they tend to be older it's like yeah okay older people one of the one of the best predictors of wealth is age right so but then you think well wait a second are we really so upset about that first of all is it obvious to me at all that like the typical 75 year old wealthy white male would probably give up 99 of his fortune to be an attractive 18 year old man right right and so there is biological Capital right and when you're young you have a lot of biological capital and then possibly what you do is you exchange some of that biological capital for monetary Capital as it as the biological capital deteriorates and it doesn't look to me that like it's not self-evident at all that that produces all the advantage on the side of the people with the monetary Capital right not at all right in fact a lot of what you spend your money on if you have monetary capital is the attempt to regain biological Capital right so so the the analysis of where the Pareto distribution uh Advantage lies is very unsophisticated well and and that's that's why I mean we'll have these kind of debates and the question is if you're concerned about an injustice is there Injustice absolutely what are you going to do about yeah like what are you going to do is there Injustice of course there is let's go do something about it there's either incredible opportunity or extremely unfair Injustice go pick something to do well if you're not willing to go get an apprenticeship or go do work or go see one person well that's the other problem too is that I think that the universities have offered young people a really easy way out because they're looking for a pathway to Virtue right that's part of the Miss ionic impulse of late adolescence and the universities say well all you have to do is identify the problem one problem when there's actually like a thousand Rivals right and and not obviously reducible to a single problem and then all you have to do is oppose the problem and that's not right that right like I talked to this woman Temple Grandin who um has redesigned all the cattle handling facilities in slaughterhouses across the world autistic woman from the University of Chicago absolute genius amazing person amazing person and uh you know she cared about Animal Welfare but she was realistic girl she grew up on a farm she knew what animals were like she's no Pie in the Sky dreamer and autistic people tend not to be right and she spent her whole life working on that problem and she's ameliorated a tremendous amount of animal suffering but not because she was concerned about it right because she was concerned about it and then she devoted her whole life to it yes right and so and that's how you accrue genuine moral virtue well think of it we would tell her story as a hero story yeah I'm like this is what you go do oh and by the way it it's going to cost you your whole life yeah right oh and the other question is if you're not going to spend your life on that you're going to spend it on something yes absolutely right and so let's take one step yes let's go to help one cow at the I mean you're like if you're gonna help animal cruelty yeah let's go do something about one animal to rescue it in a systematic way you could build so we have people from the left lots of left right in the Active network yeah but they believe in principles of fair play and freedom and you know and they sign off and they say and then you have a debate and that's and that's what reasonably confident people who want to fix something actually do so you you've talked about what you're doing in element preschool elementary junior high high school Etc yeah talked about the apprenticeship programs and the distributed games and the multiplicity of games and the idea that each person has something valid to contribute without that degenerating into a you know mindless Equity outcome game what's happening at what do you what are you doing on the higher education so we have kind of a moonshot project it probably won't work but we're working hard on it and it's this question of how do people discover their calling now at the Academy because we start so young and they're in it all the time people will find not their calling because when you're young that's too big but their next great adventure in life like what am I going to do for two years and so we think we've developed the right questions to ask and we've actually given back our MBA accreditation and closed the NBA School successful as it was because we could only serve 50 people a year and that wasn't enough and so we've created a series of challenges you can do in the real world with a group or a loan that are out in the world doing it that will help you figure out what you should do with your next great adventure in life we've uh we're going to run probably a hundred people through it we're running 100 people to it now and the end of this process is to be able to stand in a room full of people you've invited and say this is what I'm going to do next yeah here's how I'm going to matter yeah yeah here's who I am and where I come from yeah will you help me I need not money but I need an introduction I need a piece of factory floor I need something if you will here's what I promise to give back in return right right so it's like an investor pitch in something it's like an investor pitch for your life right right and um our foundation is willing to give up to a hundred thousand dollars per pitch now a lot of them are a thousand dollars right yeah a hundred thousand actually extraordinary it's tied to you actually following through and the idea is if we can get this delivered out in the world and you're using a phone it's not distance learning it's like a GPS like it's something you can communicate with with your friends and get together we're trying to see if we can find the patterns of how people actually stumble into an adventure or calling and then by these talks having them like Ted Talks all around the country yeah and that we're going to use that for our high schoolers but also use that to attract people of that age and college age to try to find what they want to do in their lives so that's a grand experiment it's in the early stages well we tried that as you know we tried that a bit with our future authoring program and one of the ways that we've helped people narrow in on that it's like well what do you want to do well that's pretty vague question and it's very Global and so it's complex and daunting and so we broke that down into eight things that people generally do you know what's your vision for an intimate relationship family friendship Job and Career Education use of time outside work civic responsibility and regulation of Temptation right now sort of the big problem is what's the purpose of my life that's broken down into a set of domains of probable problems and it's easier for people to answer those questions generally than the men than the meta question I'm nodding because we subscribe and use I mean it acted we use self-authoring as a tool and and also in this project we've looked at those individual areas and broken them into something you might do so example for the family you might have with your friends a Socratic discussion it's your daughter's first dance recital um but your biggest customer just called there's been a factory there's been a fire at his Factory right you go to the dance recital or the factory right whichever you choose it gets harder it's her wedding or it's your only customer or you know so right right so now I'm going to do that with friends but then I might actually have to write a spousal contract with my spouse or significant other and submit that to the group of this is what we've each promised each other and here's how we're going to measure it and so yeah think of this as these are Visionary 300 challenges that are hard to do and require courage and sometimes it might be going on and haggling for a discount to see what your relationship with money is yeah but we're testing those with groups and then asking how is this going to help you like self-authoring take the next step towards a Target you've picked of where you can spend your valuable life and so that's the experiment that's fun we'll see how it's gonna go it's gonna be fun it's gonna be fun yeah yeah well you should learn a lot conducting that experiment yeah well it's so nice that it's so fulfilling to provide people with methods to develop a vision for their life I mean we've been stunned by what the future authoring program was capable of doing I mean our research indicated that it raised grade point average among students in high level universities 35 percent this is a 90-minute intervention that's crazy and dropped the dropout rate 50 percent and most effectively among minority men who had a poor academic record so it was even better at eliminating their Dropout because they have a story yeah their life they're an actionable story yeah yeah yeah and then they started to develop both a vision and a strategy and also to see themselves as Visionary strategists which is a metacognitive shift now now imagine this as there's 300 high schoolers or college kids coming together to do this program you're invited by a friend to come to some mysterious party where it all gets kicked off and you start doing these challenges and sampling them well that's where you may meet your mate yeah right so that's where you're going to paint your face and go to the football game so we're trying to see is can we create that in a bottom-up way yeah and will we be successful nah we'll mess it up and we'll experiment but it's a cool it's an interesting experiment to see if that's the replacement because colleges are not helping people find their calling they don't do that anymore I mean and so we're really trying to say can we get people off on an adventure so that's that's the experiment all right all right all right well that's probably a good place to wrap up unless there is anything you can think of that we should have touched on in this part of the discussion I'm going to move for everyone watching and listening I do an extra 30 minutes with my guests I'm very interested in how people's Destiny makes itself manifest to them in the course of their life particularly if they've been successful because well why wouldn't you want to hear about why wouldn't you want to hear about multiple Pathways to success assuming that you're trying to accomplish something like that for yourself which seems preferable to the alternative by the way and so we'll switch to the Daily wire plus platform um is there anything else that we didn't cover today that you think would be no I just want to thank you because your focus on story and listening to you and the archetypes and how story matters has greatly impacted all the decisions we've made over the last 10 years to be able to provide those same kinds of patterns for young people all around the world and it wouldn't it would not have happened in the same way without you so thank you oh hey man well I when I hear you say that I think yeah well it and that wouldn't have happened with all the group without all the great people that I read who knew that sort of who knew that who were able to provide me with that knowledge you know I mean I had great instructors practically my mentors people like Robert peel and then also the people I was fortunate enough to be introduced to in various ways while I was in university and so it's great to see this sort of information make itself manifest you know Camille Paglia great literary critics suggested to me at one point that had the universities turned to the jungian school Carl Jung and mirchia Elliott and Eric Neumann then deep narrative analysts instead of dareda and Foucault that the entire history of the development of higher education would have been absolutely the last 40 years absolutely it's very interesting to see that starting to happen and I really see it is spreading like mad the idea that there are these fundamental unifying narratives Contra the post-modernist Viewpoint that they don't point to power as the fundamental human motivation right but there's something like the ongoing humble search for continued Enlightenment something like that yeah it's a wonderful thing to see that all about that is the battle between good and evil yeah it really is yeah yeah yeah yeah so all right welcome to everybody watching and listening on YouTube and the associated platforms thanks for your time and attention uh to the Daily wire plus people for facilitating this conversation making it possible practically that's much appreciated to the film crew here in Fort Worth Texas because that's where we are today thank you guys for your help today and uh join us on the daily wire plus platform for an additional half an hour of just question with Jeff Sandifer thanks very much everyone hello everyone I would encourage you to continue listening to my conversation with my guest on dailywireplus.com
