## Transcript

when you love someone you love them not only despite their fragility but also because of it they wouldn't be who they were if they weren't fragile and limited in their particular way when you have a sick kid it's like oh my god how can the world be constituted so that a child can unfairly suffer in this manner you can't have them being vulnerable and cute and interesting and and small and needing care but striving to develop and grow without them also being prone to pain and destruction and vulnerability and then what do you do teach them to be strong that's what you do you don't get rid of the vulnerability you teach them to be strong you don't protect your children in fact you do you do the opposite you expose them to the world as much as you possibly can and you make them strong that's the best antidote to their vulnerability the first noble truth of Buddhism life is suffering this is true and it's worse than that because it's suffering contaminated by malevolence and so that's very pessimistic but the optimistic part is that you are so damn tough you can actually not only deal with that oh well that's a horrible situation but it turns out that I'm armed for the task that's that's a great thing for people to know I think the fact that we're armed for the task is even more true than the fact that life is catastrophe contaminated by malevolence we're stronger than things are terrible and I do believe it's the case because I've watched people do very difficult things like people who work in palliative care Ward's so all they're ever dealing with is pain and death right and they can do it and get up in the morning they go to work and they take care of those people they lose people on a weekly basis and yet they can do it and what that shows is that if you turn around and you confront the suffering voluntarily you find out that you are way tougher than you think it's not that life is better than you think life is as harsh as you think it might even be worse but you are way tougher than you think if you turn around and confront it it's a very good thing to know and it's not naive optimism it's a very different thing it's like no things are terrible they're brutal and you are so damn tough you can't believe it you
