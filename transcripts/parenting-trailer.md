## Transcript

There is nothing you'll do in life that's more challenging, difficult, and rewarding than being a parent. Nothing with greater highs or lower lows. You have little kids for a very short period of time. It is a major mistake not to notice that and not to appreciate it. We're dealing with a pattern of misbehaviors with our son who's 3 years old. Whenever we want to leave the house, he starts running away. We have to be places at certain times when a disciplinary issue arises. You need to make space to master it.

I have to not do what I thought I was going to do for 10 minutes to set this right. Our 13-year-old throws tantrums quite often when he doesn't get his way. We spoiled the heck out of him. When you spoil a child, so to speak, you take away from them the opportunity to develop their own competence by doing too many things for them. The consequences of his abdication of thought is that other people think for him. That's what'll happen. Our daughter was bullied at her school. As this is happening, our son turned to some substance abuse.

Look for mood changes and behavioral changes. And then you can tell your kid, look, it might be an unpleasant conversation that we have to have, but I'm not going to let you be miserable and drift away. Discuss the disciplinary strategies. Discuss the rules. Discuss what it is that you want from your child. Talk that through so that you're the same person. The more effective you are in laying out these disciplinary rules, the more they'll like you. Rules consistently applied with minimal force and plenty of patience.

You don't want to let your worry destroy the pleasures of the moment. Just because children know less about the world doesn't mean they're not paying attention. It certainly doesn't mean that they're stupid. They're not stupid and they're watching.
